\item[\textbf{A1.}]
Find the largest possible integer 
$k$, 
 such that the following statement is true:

Let 
$2009$
 arbitrary non-degenerated triangles be given. In every triangle the three sides are coloured, such that one is blue, one is red and one is white. Now, for every colour separately, let us sort the lengths of the sides. We obtain
\[ \left. \begin{array}{rcl}
 & b_1 \leq b_2\leq\ldots\leq b_{2009} & \textrm{the lengths of the blue sides }\\
 & r_1 \leq r_2\leq\ldots\leq r_{2009} & \textrm{the lengths of the red sides }\\
 \textrm{and } & w_1 \leq w_2\leq\ldots\leq w_{2009} & \textrm{the lengths of the white sides }\\
 \end{array}\right.\]


Then there exist 
$k$
 indices 
$j$
 such that we can form a non-degenerated triangle with side lengths 
$b_j$, 
$r_j$, 
$w_j$.

\item[\textbf{A2.}]
Let 
$a$, 
$b$, 
$c$
 be positive real numbers such that 
$\dfrac{1}{a} + \dfrac{1}{b} + \dfrac{1}{c} = a+b+c$.
 Prove that:
\[\frac{1}{(2a+b+c)^2}+\frac{1}{(a+2b+c)^2}+\frac{1}{(a+b+2c)^2}\leq \frac{3}{16}.\]

\item[\textbf{A3.}]
Determine all functions 
$ f$
 from the set of positive integers to the set of positive integers such that, for all positive integers 
$ a$
 and 
$ b$, 
 there exists a non-degenerate triangle with sides of lengths
\[ a, f(b) \text{ and } f(b + f(a) - 1).\]

(A triangle is non-degenerate if its vertices are not collinear.)

\item[\textbf{A4.}]
Let 
$a$, 
$b$, 
$c$
 be positive real numbers such that 
$ab+bc+ca\leq 3abc$.
 Prove that
\[\sqrt{\frac{a^2+b^2}{a+b}}+\sqrt{\frac{b^2+c^2}{b+c}}+\sqrt{\frac{c^2+a^2}{c+a}}+3\leq \sqrt{2}\left(\sqrt{a+b}+\sqrt{b+c}+\sqrt{c+a}\right)\]

\item[\textbf{A5.}]
Let 
$f$
 be any function that maps the set of real numbers into the set of real numbers. Prove that there exist real numbers 
$x$
 and 
$y$
 such that 
\[f\left(x-f(y)\right)>yf(x)+x\]

\item[\textbf{A6.}]
Suppose that 
$ s_1,s_2,s_3, \ldots$
 is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers such that the sub-sequences 
\[s_{s_1},\, s_{s_2},\, s_{s_3},\, \ldots\qquad\text{and}\qquad s_{s_1+1},\, s_{s_2+1},\, s_{s_3+1},\, \ldots\]
 are both arithmetic progressions. Prove that the sequence 
$ s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots$
 is itself an arithmetic progression.

\item[\textbf{A7.}]
Find all functions 
$f$
 from the set of real numbers into the set of real numbers which satisfy for all 
$x$, 
$y$
 the identity 
\[ f\left(xf(x+y)\right) = f\left(yf(x)\right) +x^2\]
