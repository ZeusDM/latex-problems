\item[\textbf{N1.}]Determine all positive integers $ n\geq 2$ that satisfy the following condition: for all $ a$ and $ b$ relatively prime to $ n$ we have \[a \equiv b \pmod n\qquad\text{if and only if}\qquad ab\equiv 1 \pmod n.\]

\item[\textbf{N2.}]For a positive integer $n$,  let $d(n)$ be the number of all positive divisors of $n$. Find all positive integers $n$ such that $d(n)^3=4n$.

\item[\textbf{N3.}]Does there exist a positive integer $ n$ such that $ n$ has exactly 2000 prime divisors and $ n$ divides $ 2^n + 1$)

\item[\textbf{N4.}]Find all triplets of positive integers $ (a,m,n)$ such that  $ a^m + 1 \mid (a + 1)^n$.

\item[\textbf{N5.}]Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers $ n$ such that $ p = nr,$ where $ p$ and $ r$ are respectively the semiperimeter and the inradius of a triangle with integer side lengths.

\item[\textbf{N6.}]Show that the set of positive integers that cannot be represented as a sum of distinct perfect squares is finite.
