\item[\textbf{N1.}]
Call admissible a set 
$A$
 of integers that has the following property:


If 
$x,y \in A$
 (possibly 
$x=y$)
 then 
$x^2+kxy+y^2 \in A$
 for every integer 
$k$.


Determine all pairs 
$m,n$
 of nonzero integers such that the only admissible set containing both 
$m$
 and 
$n$
 is the set of all integers.

\item[\textbf{N2.}]
Find all triples 
$(x,y,z)$
 of positive integers such that 
$x \leq y \leq z$
 and
\[x^3(y^3+z^3)=2012(xyz+2).\]

\item[\textbf{N3.}]
Determine all integers 
$m \geq 2$
 such that every 
$n$
 with 
$\frac{m}{3} \leq n \leq \frac{m}{2}$
 divides the binomial coefficient 
$\binom{n}{m-2n}$.

\item[\textbf{N4.}]
An integer 
$a$
 is called friendly if the equation 
$(m^2+n)(n^2+m)=a(m-n)^3$
 has a solution over the positive integers.
a)
 Prove that there are at least 
$500$
 friendly integers in the set 
$\{ 1,2,\ldots ,2012\}$.
b)
 Decide whether 
$a=2$
 is friendly.

\item[\textbf{N5.}]
For a nonnegative integer 
$n$
 define 
$\operatorname{rad}(n)=1$
 if 
$n=0$
 or 
$n=1$, 
 and 
$\operatorname{rad}(n)=p_1p_2\cdots p_k$
 where 
$p_1<p_2<\cdots <p_k$
 are all prime factors of 
$n$.
 Find all polynomials 
$f(x)$
 with nonnegative integer coefficients such that 
$\operatorname{rad}(f(n))$
 divides 
$\operatorname{rad}(f(n^{\operatorname{rad}(n)}))$
 for every nonnegative integer 
$n$.

\item[\textbf{N6.}]
Let 
$x$
 and 
$y$
 be positive integers. If 
${x^{2^n}}-1$
 is divisible by 
$2^ny+1$
 for every positive integer 
$n$, 
 prove that 
$x=1$.

\item[\textbf{N7.}]
Find all positive integers 
$n$
 for which there exist non-negative integers 
$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$
 such that
\[
\frac{1}{2^{a_1}} + \frac{1}{2^{a_2}} + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{a_n}} = 
\frac{1}{3^{a_1}} + \frac{2}{3^{a_2}} + \cdots + \frac{n}{3^{a_n}} = 1.
\]

\item[\textbf{N8.}]
Prove that for every prime 
$p>100$
 and every integer 
$r$, 
 there exist two integers 
$a$
 and 
$b$
 such that 
$p$
 divides 
$a^2+b^5-r$.
