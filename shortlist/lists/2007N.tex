\item[\textbf{N1.}]
Find all pairs of natural numbers 
$ (a, b)$
 such that 
$ 7^a - 3^b$
 divides 
$ a^4 + b^2$.

\item[\textbf{N2.}]
Let 
$b,n > 1$
 be integers. Suppose that for each 
$k > 1$
 there exists an integer 
$a_k$
 such that 
$b - a^n_k$
 is divisible by 
$k$.
 Prove that 
$b = A^n$
 for some integer 
$A$.

\item[\textbf{N3.}]
Let 
$ X$
 be a set of 10,000 integers, none of them is divisible by 47. Prove that there exists a 2007-element subset 
$ Y$
 of 
$ X$
 such that 
$ a - b + c - d + e$
 is not divisible by 47 for any 
$ a,b,c,d,e \in Y.$

\item[\textbf{N4.}]
For every integer 
$ k \geq 2,$
 prove that 
$ 2^{3k}$
 divides the number
\[ \binom{2^{k + 1}}{2^{k}} - \binom{2^{k}}{2^{k - 1}}
\]


but 
$ 2^{3k + 1}$
 does not.

\item[\textbf{N5.}]
Find all surjective functions 
$ f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$
 such that for every 
$ m,n \in \mathbb{N}$
 and every prime 
$ p,$
 the number 
$ f(m + n)$
 is divisible by 
$ p$
 if and only if 
$ f(m) + f(n)$
 is divisible by 
$ p$.

\item[\textbf{N6.}]
Let 
$ k$
 be a positive integer. Prove that the number 
$ (4 \cdot k^2 - 1)^2$
 has a positive divisor of the form 
$ 8kn - 1$
 if and only if 
$ k$
 is even.
Actual IMO 2007 Problem, posed as question 5 in the contest, which was used as a lemma in the official solutions for problem N6 as shown above.

\item[\textbf{N7.}]
For a prime 
$ p$
 and a given integer 
$ n$
 let 
$ \nu_p(n)$
 denote the exponent of 
$ p$
 in the prime factorisation of 
$ n!$.
 Given 
$ d \in \mathbb{N}$
 and 
$ \{p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_k\}$
 a set of 
$ k$
 primes, show that there are infinitely many positive integers 
$ n$
 such that 
$ d\mid \nu_{p_i}(n)$
 for all 
$ 1 \leq i \leq k$.
