\item[\textbf{N1.}]Prove that there is no positive integer $n$ such that, for $k = 1,2,\ldots,9$,  the leftmost digit (in decimal notation) of $(n+k)!$ equals $k$.

\item[\textbf{N2.}]Consider the system \begin{align*}x + y  &= z + u,\\2xy & = zu.\end{align*}Find the greatest value of the real constant $m$ such that $m \leq x/y$ for any positive integer solution $(x,y,z,u)$ of the system, with $x \geq y$.

\item[\textbf{N3.}]Let $ a_1 = 11^{11}, \, a_2 = 12^{12}, \, a_3 = 13^{13}$,  and $ a_n = |a_{n - 1} - a_{n - 2}| + |a_{n - 2} - a_{n - 3}|, n \geq 4.$ Determine $ a_{14^{14}}$.

\item[\textbf{N4.}]Let $p \geq 5$ be a prime number. Prove that there exists an integer $a$ with $1 \leq a \leq p-2$ such that neither $a^{p-1}-1$ nor $(a+1)^{p-1}-1$ is divisible by $p^2$.

\item[\textbf{N5.}]Let $a > b > c > d$ be positive integers and suppose that \[ ac + bd = (b+d+a-c)(b+d-a+c).  \] Prove that $ab + cd$ is not prime.

\item[\textbf{N6.}]Is it possible to find  $100$ positive integers not exceeding $25,000$,  such that all pairwise sums of them are different?
