\item[\textbf{N1.}]
Find the least positive integer 
$n$
 for which there exists a set 
$\{s_1, s_2, \ldots , s_n\}$
 consisting of 
$n$
 distinct positive integers such that
\[ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{s_1} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{1}{s_2} \right) \cdots \left( 1 - \frac{1}{s_n} \right) = \frac{51}{2010}.\]

\item[\textbf{N2.}]
Find all pairs 
$(m,n)$
 of nonnegative integers for which 
\[m^2 + 2 \cdot 3^n = m\left(2^{n+1} - 1\right).\]

\item[\textbf{N3.}]
Find the smallest number 
$n$
 such that there exist polynomials 
$f_1, f_2, \ldots , f_n$
 with rational coefficients satisfying 
\[x^2+7 = f_1\left(x\right)^2 + f_2\left(x\right)^2 + \ldots + f_n\left(x\right)^2.\]

\item[\textbf{N4.}]
Let 
$a, b$
 be integers, and let 
$P(x) = ax^3+bx.$
 For any positive integer 
$n$
 we say that the pair 
$(a,b)$
 is 
$n$-good if 
$n | P(m)-P(k)$
 implies 
$n | m - k$
 for all integers 
$m, k.$
 We say that 
$(a,b)$
 is 
$very \ good$
 if 
$(a,b)$
 is 
$n$-good for infinitely many positive integers 
$n.$

(a)
 Find a pair 
$(a,b)$
 which is 51-good, but not very good.
 
(b)
 Show that all 2010-good pairs are very good.

\item[\textbf{N5.}]
Find all functions 
$g:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$
 such that 
\[\left(g(m)+n\right)\left(g(n)+m\right)\]
 is a perfect square for all 
$m,n\in\mathbb{N}.$

\item[\textbf{N6.}]
The rows and columns of a 
$2^n \times 2^n$
 table are numbered from 
$0$
 to 
$2^{n}-1.$
 The cells of the table have been coloured with the following property being satisfied: for each 
$0 \leq i,j \leq 2^n - 1,$
 the 
$j$-th cell in the 
$i$-th row and the 
$(i+j)$-th cell in the 
$j$-th row have the same colour. (The indices of the cells in a row are considered modulo 
$2^n$.) Prove that the maximal possible number of colours is 
$2^n$.
