\item[\textbf{N1.}]
For any integer 
$d > 0,$
 let 
$f(d)$
 be the smallest possible integer that has exactly 
$d$
 positive divisors (so for example we have 
$f(1)=1, f(5)=16,$
 and 
$f(6)=12$)
. Prove that for every integer 
$k \geq 0$
 the number 
$f\left(2^k\right)$
 divides 
$f\left(2^{k+1}\right).$

\item[\textbf{N2.}]
Consider a polynomial 
$P(x) =  \prod^9_{j=1}(x+d_j),$
 where 
$d_1, d_2, \ldots d_9$
 are nine distinct integers. Prove that there exists an integer 
$N,$
 such that for all integers 
$x \geq N$
 the number 
$P(x)$
 is divisible by a prime number greater than 20.

\item[\textbf{N3.}]
Let 
$n \geq 1$
 be an odd integer. Determine all functions 
$f$
 from the set of integers to itself, such that for all integers 
$x$
 and 
$y$
 the difference 
$f(x)-f(y)$
 divides 
$x^n-y^n.$

\item[\textbf{N4.}]
For each positive integer 
$k,$
 let 
$t(k)$
 be the largest odd divisor of 
$k.$
 Determine all positive integers 
$a$
 for which there exists a positive integer 
$n,$
 such that all the differences
\[t(n+a)-t(n); t(n+a+1)-t(n+1), \ldots, t(n+2a-1)-t(n+a-1)\]
 are divisible by 4.

\item[\textbf{N5.}]
Let 
$f$
 be a function from the set of integers to the set of positive integers. Suppose that, for any two integers 
$m$
 and 
$n$, 
 the difference 
$f(m) - f(n)$
 is divisible by 
$f(m- n)$.
 Prove that, for all integers 
$m$
 and 
$n$
 with 
$f(m) \leq f(n)$, 
 the number 
$f(n)$
 is divisible by 
$f(m)$.

\item[\textbf{N6.}]
Let 
$P(x)$
 and 
$Q(x)$
 be two polynomials with integer coefficients, such that no nonconstant polynomial with rational coefficients divides both 
$P(x)$
 and 
$Q(x).$
 Suppose that for every positive integer 
$n$
 the integers 
$P(n)$
 and 
$Q(n)$
 are positive, and 
$2^{Q(n)}-1$
 divides 
$3^{P(n)}-1.$
 Prove that 
$Q(x)$
 is a constant polynomial.

\item[\textbf{N7.}]
Let 
$p$
 be an odd prime number. For every integer 
$a,$
 define the number 
$S_a = \sum^{p-1}_{j=1} \frac{a^j}{j}.$
 Let 
$m,n \in \mathbb{Z},$
 such that 
$S_3 + S_4 - 3S_2 = \frac{m}{n}.$
 Prove that 
$p$
 divides 
$m.$

\item[\textbf{N8.}]
Let 
$k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$
 and set 
$n=2^k+1.$
 Prove that 
$n$
 is a prime number if and only if the following holds: there is a permutation 
$a_{1},\ldots,a_{n-1}$
 of the numbers 
$1,2, \ldots, n-1$
 and a sequence of integers 
$g_{1},\ldots,g_{n-1},$
 such that 
$n$
 divides 
$g^{a_i}_i - a_{i+1}$
 for every 
$i \in \{1,2,\ldots,n-1\},$
 where we set 
$a_n = a_1.$
