\item[\textbf{N1.}]What is the smallest positive integer $t$ such that there exist integers $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_t$ with  \[x^3_1+x^3_2+\,\ldots\,+x^3_t=2002^{2002}\,?\]

\item[\textbf{N2.}]Let $n\geq2$ be a positive integer, with divisors $1=d_1<d_2<\,\ldots<d_k=n$.  Prove that $d_1d_2+d_2d_3+\,\ldots\,+d_{k-1}d_k$ is always less than $n^2$,  and determine when it is a divisor of $n^2$.

\item[\textbf{N3.}]Let $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n$ be distinct primes greater than $3$. Show that $2^{p_1p_2\cdots p_n}+1$ has at least $4^n$ divisors.

\item[\textbf{N4.}]Is there a positive integer $m$ such that the equation \[ {\frac{1}{a}}+{\frac{1}{b}}+{\frac{1}{c}}+{\frac{1}{abc}}={\frac{m}{a+b+c}}  \] has infinitely many solutions in positive integers $a,b,c$)

\item[\textbf{N5.}]Let $m,n\geq2$ be positive integers, and let $a_1,a_2,\ldots ,a_n$ be integers, none of which is a multiple of $m^{n-1}$.  Show that there exist integers $e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_n$,  not all zero, with $\left|{\,e}_i\,\right|<m$ for all $i$,  such that $e_1a_1+e_2a_2+\,\ldots\,+e_na_n$ is a multiple of $m^n$.

\item[\textbf{N6.}]Find all pairs of positive integers $m,n\geq3$ for which there exist infinitely many positive integers $a$ such that \[ \frac{a^m+a-1}{a^n+a^2-1}  \] is itself an integer.
