Let 
$ n$
 be a positive integer and let 
$ a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots,a_k$

$ { 1,2,\ldots,n}$

$ i = 1,2,\ldots,k - 1$.

$ n$
 does not divide 
$ a_k(a_1 - 1).$

\item[\textbf{N2.}]
A positive integer 
$N$
 is called 
balanced
, if 
$N=1$
 or if 
$N$
 can be written as a product of an even number of not necessarily distinct primes. Given positive integers 
$a$
 and 
$b$, 
 consider the polynomial 
$P$
 defined by 
$P(x)=(x+a)(x+b)$.

(a) Prove that there exist distinct positive integers 
$a$
 and 
$b$
 such that all the number 
$P(1)$, 
$P(2)$, 
$\ldots$, 
$P(50)$
 are balanced.

(b) Prove that if 
$P(n)$
 is balanced for all positive integers 
$n$, 
 then 
$a=b$.

\item[\textbf{N3.}]
Let 
$f$
 be a non-constant function from the set of positive integers into the set of positive integer, such that 
$a-b$
 divides 
$f(a)-f(b)$
 for all distinct positive integers 
$a$, 
$b$.
 Prove that there exist infinitely many primes 
$p$
 such that 
$p$
 divides 
$f(c)$
 for some positive integer 
$c$.

\item[\textbf{N4.}]
Find all positive integers 
$n$
 such that there exists a sequence of positive integers
$a_1$, 
$a_2$, 
$\ldots$, 
$a_n$
 satisfying: 
\[a_{k+1}=\frac{a_k^2+1}{a_{k-1}+1}-1\]
 for every 
$k$
 with 
$2\leq k\leq n-1$.

\item[\textbf{N5.}]
Let 
$P(x)$
 be a non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients. Prove that there is no function 
$T$
 from the set of integers into the set of integers such that the number of integers 
$x$
 with 
$T^n(x)=x$
 is equal to 
$P(n)$
 for every 
$n\geq 1$, 
 where 
$T^n$
 denotes the 
$n$-fold application of 
$T$.

\item[\textbf{N6.}]
Let 
$k$
 be a positive integer. Show that if there exists a sequence 
$a_0,a_1,\ldots$
 of integers satisfying the condition 
\[a_n=\frac{a_{n-1}+n^k}{n}\text{ for all } n\geq 1,\]
then 
$k-2$
 is divisible by 
$3$.

\item[\textbf{N7.}]
Let 
$a$
 and 
$b$
 be distinct integers greater than 
$1$.
 Prove that there exists a positive integer 
$n$
 such that 
$(a^n-1)(b^n-1)$
 is not a perfect square.
