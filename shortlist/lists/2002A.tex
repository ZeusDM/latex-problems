\item[\textbf{A2.}]Let $a_1,a_2,\ldots$ be an infinite sequence of real numbers, for which there exists a real number $c$ with $0\leq a_i\leq c$ for all $i$,  such that \[\left\lvert a_i-a_j \right\rvert\geq \frac{1}{i+j} \quad \text{for all }i,\ j \text{ with } i \neq j. \] Prove that $c\geq1$.

\item[\textbf{A3.}]Let $P$ be a cubic polynomial given by $P(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d$,  where $a,b,c,d$ are integers and $a\ne0$. Suppose that $xP(x)=yP(y)$ for infinitely many pairs $x,y$ of integers with $x\ne y$. Prove that the equation $P(x)=0$ has an integer root.

\item[\textbf{A4.}]Find all functions $f$ from the reals to the reals such that \[ \left(f(x)+f(z)\right)\left(f(y)+f(t)\right)=f(xy-zt)+f(xt+yz)  \] for all real $x,y,z,t$.

\item[\textbf{A5.}]Let $n$ be a positive integer that is not a perfect cube. Define real numbers $a,b,c$ by\[a=\root3\of n,\qquad b={\frac{1}{a-[a]}},\qquad c={\frac{1}{b-[b]}},\]

where $[x]$ denotes the integer part of $x$. Prove that there are infinitely many such integers $n$ with the property that there exist integers $r,s,t$,  not all zero, such that $ra+sb+tc=0$.

\item[\textbf{A6.}]Let $A$ be a non-empty set of positive integers. Suppose that there are positive integers $b_1,\ldots b_n$ and $c_1,\ldots,c_n$ such that

\begin{itemize}
\item for each $i$ the set $b_iA+c_i=\left\{b_ia+c_i\colon a\in A\right\}$ is a subset of $A$,  and
\item the sets $b_iA+c_i$ and $b_jA+c_j$ are disjoint whenever $i\ne j$
