	\section{Motivation Problem}

	\begin{prob}
		23 candidates are running for a political office. There is an efficient betting market and $p_i$ is the ``market percent probability'' that the $i$th candidate wins. Assume each $p_i$ is an integer greater than $1$ and that $\sum p_i = 100$.

		The $p_i$ evolve in time. Write $p_i(t)$ for the value at time $t$.

		Assume that if $p_i$ is a number $k \in \{1, 2, \dots, 99\}$ at some given time, then the next integer value that $p_i$ attains is $k+1$ with probability $1/2$ and $k-1$ with probability $1/2$.

		The $i$th candidate makes an epic comeback if $p_i$ gets all the way down $1$ before getting to $100$.

		What is the probability that somebody will make an epic comeback?
	\end{prob}

	\section{Martingale definition}

		Let $S$ be a probability space.

		Let $X_0, X_1, \dots$ be a sequence of random quantities (a.k.a. random variables).

		\begin{defn}[The Martingale Property]
			$$\EE[X_{n+1}| \mathcal{F}_n] = X_n$$
		\end{defn}
