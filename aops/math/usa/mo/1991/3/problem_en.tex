Show that, for any fixed integer $\,n \geq 1,\,$ the sequence \[ 2, \; 2^2, \; 2^{2^2}, \; 2^{2^{2^2}}, \ldots (\mbox{mod} \; n)  \]is eventually constant.

[The tower of exponents is defined by $a_1 = 2, \; a_{i+1} = 2^{a_i}$. Also $a_i \; (\mbox{mod} \; n)$ means the remainder which results from dividing $a_i$ by $n$.]
