Let $\, D \,$ be an arbitrary point on side $\, AB \,$ of a given triangle $\, ABC, \,$ and let $\, E \,$ be the interior point where $\, CD \,$ intersects the external common tangent to the incircles of triangles $\, ACD \,$ and $\, BCD$.  As $\, D \,$ assumes all positions between $\, A \,$ and $\, B \,$,  prove that the point $\, E \,$ traces the arc of a circle.
