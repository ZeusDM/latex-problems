Let $n$ be a nonnegative integer. Determine the number of ways that one can choose $(n+1)^2$ sets $S_{i,j}\subseteq\{1,2,\ldots,2n\}$,  for integers $i,j$ with $0\leq i,j\leq n$,  such that:

for all $0\leq i,j\leq n$,  the set $S_{i,j}$ has $i+j$ elements; and$S_{i,j}\subseteq S_{k,l}$ whenever $0\leq i\leq k\leq n$ and $0\leq j\leq l\leq n$.
