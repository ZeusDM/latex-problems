Let $\, a,b \,$ be odd positive integers.  Define the sequence $\, (f_n ) \,$ by putting $\, f_1 = a,$ $f_2 = b, \,$ and by letting $\, f_n \,$ for $\, n \geq 3 \,$ be the greatest odd divisor of $\, f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$.  Show that $\, f_n \,$ is constant for $\, n \,$ sufficiently large and determine the eventual value as a function of $\, a \,$ and $\, b$.
