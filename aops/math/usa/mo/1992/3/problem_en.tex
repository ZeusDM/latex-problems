For a nonempty set $\, S \,$ of integers, let $\, \sigma(S) \,$ be the sum of the elements of $\, S$.  Suppose that $\, A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{11} \} \,$ is a set of positive integers with $\, a_1 < a_2 < \cdots < a_{11} \,$ and that, for each positive integer $\, n\leq 1500, \,$ there is a subset  $\, S \,$ of $\, A \,$ for which $\, \sigma(S) = n$.  What is the smallest possible value of $\, a_{10}$?
