To clip a convex $n$-gon means to choose a pair of consecutive sides $AB, BC$ and to replace them by the three segments $AM, MN$,  and $NC$,  where $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$ and $N$ is the midpoint of $BC$.  In other words, one cuts off the triangle $MBN$ to obtain a convex $(n+1)$-gon.  A regular hexagon ${\cal P}_6$ of area 1 is clipped to obtain a heptagon ${\cal P}_7$.  Then ${\cal P}_7$ is clipped (in one of the seven possible ways) to obtain an octagon ${\cal P}_8$,  and so on.  Prove that no matter how the clippings are done, the area of ${\cal P}_n$ is greater than $\frac 13$,  for all $n \geq 6$.
