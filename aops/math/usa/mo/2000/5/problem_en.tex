Let $A_1A_2A_3$ be a triangle and let $\omega_1$ be a circle in its plane passing through $A_1$ and $A_2.$ Suppose there exist circles $\omega_2, \omega_3, \dots, \omega_7$ such that for $k = 2, 3, \dots, 7,$ $\omega_k$ is externally tangent to $\omega_{k-1}$ and passes through $A_k$ and $A_{k+1},$  where $A_{n+3} = A_{n}$ for all $n \ge 1$. Prove that $\omega_7 = \omega_1.$
