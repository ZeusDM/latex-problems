Let $S$ be the set of all triangles $ABC$ for which \[ 5 \left( \dfrac{1}{AP} + \dfrac{1}{BQ} + \dfrac{1}{CR} \right) - \dfrac{3}{\min\{ AP, BQ, CR \}} = \dfrac{6}{r},  \] where $r$ is the inradius and $P, Q, R$ are the points of tangency of the incircle with sides $AB, BC, CA,$ respectively. Prove that all triangles in $S$ are isosceles  and similar to one another.
