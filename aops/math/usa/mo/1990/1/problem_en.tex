A certain state issues license plates consisting of six digits (from 0 to 9).  The state requires that any two license plates differ in at least two places.  (For instance, the numbers 027592 and 020592 cannot both be used.)  Determine, with proof, the maximum number of distinct license plates that the state can use.
