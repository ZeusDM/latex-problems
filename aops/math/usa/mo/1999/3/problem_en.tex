Let $p > 2$ be a prime and let $a,b,c,d$ be integers not divisible by $p$,  such that\[ \left\{ \dfrac{ra}{p} \right\} + \left\{ \dfrac{rb}{p} \right\} + \left\{ \dfrac{rc}{p} \right\} + \left\{ \dfrac{rd}{p} \right\} = 2  \]

for any integer $r$ not divisible by $p$. Prove that at least two of the numbers $a+b$,  $a+c$,  $a+d$,  $b+c$,  $b+d$,  $c+d$ are divisible by $p$.

(Note: $\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor$ denotes the fractional part of $x$.)
