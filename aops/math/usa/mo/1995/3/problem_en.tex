Given a nonisosceles, nonright triangle ABC, let O denote the center of its circumscribed circle, and let $A_1$,  $B_1$,  and $C_1$ be the midpoints of sides BC, CA, and AB, respectively. Point $A_2$ is located on the ray $OA_1$ so that $OAA_1$ is similar to $OA_2A$. Points $B_2$ and $C_2$ on rays $OB_1$ and $OC_1$,  respectively, are defined similarly. Prove that lines $AA_2$,  $BB_2$,  and $CC_2$ are concurrent, i.e. these three lines intersect at a point.
