The sides of a 99-gon are initially colored so that consecutive sides are red, blue, red, blue, $\,\ldots, \,$ red, blue, yellow. We make a sequence of modifications in the coloring, changing the color of one side at a time to one of the three given colors (red, blue, yellow), under the constraint that no two adjacent sides may be the same color.  By making a sequence of such modifications, is it possible to arrive at the coloring in which consecutive sides

are red, blue, red, blue, red, blue, $\, \ldots, \,$ red, yellow, blue?
