Let $\mathbf{Z}$ denote the set of all integers. Find all real numbers $c > 0$ such that there exists a labeling of the lattice points $ ( x, y ) \in \mathbf{Z}^2$ with positive integers for which:

only finitely many distinct labels occur, andfor each label $i$,  the distance between any two points labeled $i$ is at least $c^i$.
