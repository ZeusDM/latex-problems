For a permutation $p = (a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_9)$ of the digits $1,2,\ldots,9$,  let $s(p)$ denote the sum of the three $3$-digit numbers $a_1a_2a_3$,  $a_4a_5a_6$,  and $a_7a_8a_9$. Let $m$ be the minimum value of $s(p)$ subject to the condition that the units digit of $s(p)$ is $0$. Let $n$ denote the number of permutations $p$ with $s(p) = m$. Find $|m - n|$.
