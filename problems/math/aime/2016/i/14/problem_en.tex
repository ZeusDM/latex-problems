Centered at each lattice point in the coordinate plane are a circle of radius $\tfrac{1}{10}$ and a square with sides of length $\tfrac{1}{5}$ whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes. The line segment from $(0, 0)$ to $(1001, 429)$ intersects $m$ of the squares and $n$ of the circles. Find $m + n$.
