In $\triangle ABC$ let $I$ be the center of the inscribed circle, and let the bisector of $\angle ACB$ intersect $AB$ at $L$. The line through $C$ and $L$ intersects the circumscribed circle of $\triangle ABC$ at the two points $C$ and $D$. If $LI = 2$ and $LD = 3$,  then $IC = \tfrac{p}{q}$,  where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p + q$.
