A right prism with height $h$ has bases that are regular hexagons with sides of length $12$. A vertex $A$ of the prism and its three adjacent vertices are the vertices of a triangular pyramid. The dihedral angle (the angle between the two planes) formed by the face of the pyramid that lies in a base of the prism and the face of the pyramid that does not contain $A$ measures $60^\circ$. Find $h^2$.
