There is a $40\%$ chance of rain on Saturday and a $30\%$

 of rain on Sunday. However, it is twice as likely to rain on Sunday if 

it rains on Saturday than if it does not rain on Saturday. The 

probability that it rains at least one day this weekend is $\frac{a}{b}$,  where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a+b$.
