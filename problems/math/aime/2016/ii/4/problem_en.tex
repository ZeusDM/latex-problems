An $a\times b\times c$ rectangular box is built from $a\cdot b \cdot c$ unit cubes. Each unit cube is colored red, green, or yellow. Each of the $a$ layers of size $1\times b \times c$ parallel to the $(b\times c)$-faces of the box contains exactly $9$ red cubes, exactly 12 green cubes, and some yellow cubes. Each of the $b$ layers of size $a\times 1 \times c$ parallel to the $(a\times c)$-faces of the box contains exactly 20 green cubes, exactly 25 yellow cubes, and some red cubes. Find the smallest possible volume of the box.
