Initially Alex, Betty, and Charlie had a total of $444$ peanuts. Charlie had the most peanuts, and Alex had the least. The three numbers of peanuts that each person had form a geometric progression. Alex eats 5 of his peanuts, Betty eats 9 of her peanuts, and Charlie eats 25 of his peanuts. Now the three numbers of peanuts that each person has form an arithmetic progression. Find the number of peanuts Alex had initially.
