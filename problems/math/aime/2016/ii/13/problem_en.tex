Beatrix is going to place six rooks on a $6\times6$ chessboard where both the rows and columns are labelled $1$ to $6$; the rooks are placed so that no two rooks are in the same row or the same column. The \textit{value} of a square is the sum of its row number and column number. The \textit{score} of an arrangement of rooks is the least value of any occupied square. The average score over all valid configurations is $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
