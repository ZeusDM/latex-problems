Equilateral $\triangle ABC$ has side length $600$. Points $P$ and $Q$ lie outside of the plane of $\triangle ABC$ and are on the opposite sides of the plane. Furthermore, $PA=PB=PC$, and $QA=QB=QC$, and the planes of $\triangle PAB$ and $\triangle QAB$ form a $120^{\circ}$ dihedral angle (The angle between the two planes). There is a point $O$ whose distance from each of $A,B,C,P$ and $Q$ is $d$. Find $d$.
