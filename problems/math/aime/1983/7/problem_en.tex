Twenty five of King Arthur's knights are seated at their customary round table.  Three of them are chosen - all choices of three being equally likely - and are sent off to slay a troublesome dragon.  Let $P$ be the probability that at least two of the three had been sitting next to each other.  If $P$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?
