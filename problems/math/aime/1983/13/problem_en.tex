For $\{1, 2, 3, \dots, n\}$ and each of its nonempty subsets a unique \textbf{alternating sum} is defined as follows: Arrange the numbers in the subset in decreasing order and then, beginning with the largest, alternately add and subtract successive numbers.  (For example, the alternating sum for $\{1, 2, 4, 6, 9\}$ is $9 - 6 + 4 - 2 + 1 = 6$ and for $\{5\}$ it is simply 5.)  Find the sum of all such alternating sums for $n = 7$.
