The circumcircle of acute $\triangle ABC$ has center $O$. The line passing through point $O$ perpendicular to $\overline{OB}$ intersects lines $AB$ and $BC$ at $P$ and $Q$,  respectively. Also $AB=5$,  $BC=4$,  $BQ=4.5$,  and $BP=\frac{m}{n}$,  where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
