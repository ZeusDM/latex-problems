In a new school $40$ percent of the students are freshmen, $30$ percent are sophomores, $20$ percent are juniors, and $10$ percent are seniors.  All freshmen are required to take Latin, and $80$ percent of the sophomores, $50$ percent of the juniors, and $20$ percent of the seniors elect to take Latin. The probability that a randomly chosen Latin student is a sophomore is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
