Steve says to Jon, "I am thinking of a polynomial whose roots are all positive integers. The polynomial has the form $P(x)=2x^3-2ax^2+(a^2-81)x-c$ for some positive integers $a$ and $c$. Can you tell me the values of $a$ and $c$?"

After some calculations, Jon says, "There is more than one such polynomial."

Steve says, "Youâ€™re right. Here is the value of $a$." He writes down a positive integer and asks, "Can you tell me the value of $c$?"

Jon says, "There are still two possible values of $c$."

Find the sum of the two possible values of $c$.
