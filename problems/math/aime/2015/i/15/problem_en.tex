A block of wood has the shape of a right circular cylinder with radius $6$ and height $8$,  and its entire surface has been painted blue. Points $A$ and $B$ are chosen on the edge on one of the circular faces of the cylinder so that $\overarc{AB}$ on that face measures $120^\circ$. The block is then sliced in half along the plane that passes through point $A$,  point $B$,  and the center of the cylinder, revealing a flat, unpainted face on each half. The area of one of those unpainted faces is $a\cdot\pi + b\sqrt{c}$,  where $a$,  $b$,  and $c$ are integers and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c$.$A$
