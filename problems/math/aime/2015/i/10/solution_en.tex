There is a constant $A$ such that \[f(x)^2-144=A(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-5)(x-6)(x-7).\] Let $y=x-4$ such that \[A(y+3)(y+2)(y+1)(y-1)(y-2)(y-3)+144\] is the square of a cubic polynomial. Observe that this is even. If the cubic has a $y^2$ term, then there is a $y^5$ term in its square, contradiction. If the cubic has a constant term, then there is a $y^3$ term in its square, contradiction. Thus the constant term of its square is $0$. But it is $-36A+144$, so $A=4$. It follows that $f(0)^2=5184$, so $|f(0)|=\boxed{072}$ as desired.
