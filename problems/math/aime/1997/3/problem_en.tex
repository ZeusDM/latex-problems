Sarah intended to multiply a two-digit number and a three-digit number, but she left out the multiplication sign and simply placed the two-digit number to the left of the three-digit number, thereby forming a five-digit number.  This number is exactly nine times the product Sarah should have obtained.  What is the sum of the two-digit number and the three-digit number?
