Let $ S$ be the set of points in the Cartesian plane that satisfy
\[ \Big|\big|{|x| - 2}\big| - 1\Big| + \Big|\big|{|y| - 2}\big| - 1\Big| = 1.
\]
If a model of $ S$ were built from wire of negligible thickness, then the total length of wire required would be $ a\sqrt {b},$ where $ a$ and $ b$ are positive integers and $ b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime number.  Find $ a + b.$
