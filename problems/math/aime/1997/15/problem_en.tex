The sides of rectangle $ABCD$ have lengths 10 and 11.  An equilateral triangle is drawn so that no point of the triangle lies outside $ABCD.$  The maximum possible area of such a triangle can be written in the form $p\sqrt{q}-r,$ where $p, q,$ and $r$ are positive integers, and $q$ is not divisible by the square of any prime number.  Find $p+q+r.$
