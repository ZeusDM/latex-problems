Every card in a deck has a picture of one shape - circle, square, or triangle, which is painted in one of the three colors - red, blue, or green.  Furthermore, each color is applied in one of three shades - light, medium, or dark.  The deck has 27 cards, with every shape-color-shade combination represented.  A set of three cards from the deck is called complementary if all of the following statements are true:

i. Either each of the three cards has a different shape or all three of the card have the same shape.
ii. Either each of the three cards has a different color or all three of the cards have the same color.
iii. Either each of the three cards has a different shade or all three of the cards have the same shade.

How many different complementary three-card sets are there?
