A car travels due east at $\frac 23$ mile per minute on a long, straight road.  At the same time, a circular storm, whose radius is 51 miles, moves southeast at $\frac 12\sqrt{2}$ mile per minute.  At time $t=0,$ the center of the storm is 110 miles due north of the car.  At time $t=t_1$ minutes, the car enters the storm circle, and at time $t=t_2$ minutes, the car leaves the storm circle.  Find $\frac 12(t_1+t_2).$
