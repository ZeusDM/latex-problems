David found four sticks of different lengths that can be used to form three non-congruent convex cyclic quadrilaterals, \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), which can each be inscribed in a circle with radius \(1\). Let \(\varphi_A\) denote the measure of the acute angle made by the diagonals of quadrilateral \(A\), and define \(\varphi_B\) and \(\varphi_C\) similarly. Suppose that \(\sin\varphi_A=\frac{2}{3}\), \(\sin\varphi_B=\frac{3}{5}\), and \(\sin\varphi_C=\frac{6}{7}\). All three quadrilaterals have the same area \(K\), which can be written in the form \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers. Find \(m+n\).
