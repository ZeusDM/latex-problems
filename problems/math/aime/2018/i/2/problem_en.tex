The number \(n\) can be written in base \(14\) as \(\underline{a}\) \(\underline{b}\) \(\underline{c}\),  can be written in base \(15\) as \(\underline{a}\) \(\underline{c}\) \(\underline{b}\),  and can be written in base \(6\) as \(\underline{a}\) \(\underline{c}\) \(\underline{a}\) \(\underline{c}\),  where \(a > 0\). Find the base-\(10\) representation of \(n\).
