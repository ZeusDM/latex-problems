Let \(\triangle ABC\) have side lengths \(AB=30\), \(BC=32\), and \(AC=34\). Point \(X\) lies in the interior of \(\overline{BC}\), and points \(I_1\) and \(I_2\) are the incenters of \(\triangle ABX\) and \(\triangle ACX\), respectively. Find the minimum possible area of \(\triangle AI_1I_2\) as \( X\) varies along \(\overline{BC}\).
