Triangle $ABC$ has sides $AB=9,BC = 5\sqrt{3},$ and $AC=12$. Points $A=P_0, P_1, P_2, \dots, P_{2450} = B$ are on segment $\overline{AB}$ with $P_k$ between $P_{k-1}$ and $P_{k+1}$ for $k=1,2,\dots,2449$, and points $A=Q_0, Q_1, Q_2, \dots ,Q_{2450} = C$ for $k=1,2,\dots,2449$. Furthermore, each segment $\overline{P_kQ_k}, k=1,2,\dots,2449$, is parallel to $\overline{BC}$. The segments cut the triangle into $2450$ regions, consisting of $2449$ trapezoids and $1$ triangle. Each of the $2450$ regions have the same area. Find the number of segments $\overline{P_kQ_k}, k=1,2 ,\dots,2450$, that have rational length.
