Points $A$,  $B$,  and $C$ lie in that order along a straight path where the distance from $A$ to $C$ is $1800$

 meters. Ina runs twice as fast as Eve, and Paul runs twice as fast as 

Ina. The three runners start running at the same time with Ina starting 

at $A$ and running toward $C$,  Paul starting at $B$ and running toward $C$,  and Eve starting at $C$ and running toward $A$. When Paul meets Eve, he turns around and runs toward $A$. Paul and Ina both arrive at $B$ at the same time. Find the number of meters from $A$ to $B$.
