Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with $AB=CD=10$,  $BC=14$,  and $AD=2\sqrt{65}$.  Assume that the diagonals of $ABCD$ intersect at point $P$,  and that the sum of the areas of $\triangle APB$ and $\triangle CPD$ equals the sum of the areas of $\triangle BPC$ and $\triangle APD$.  Find the area of quadrilateral $ABCD$.
