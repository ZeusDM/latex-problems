The incircle of $\omega$ of $\triangle ABC$ is tangent to $\overline{BC}$ at $X$. Let $Y \neq X$ be the other intersection of $\overline{AX}$ with $\omega$. Points $P$ and $Q$ lie on  $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$,  respectively, so that $\overline{PQ}$ is tangent to $\omega$ at $Y$. Assume that $AP=3, PB = 4, AC=8$,  and $AQ = \tfrac{m}{n}$,  where  $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
