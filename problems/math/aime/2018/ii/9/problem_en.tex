Octagon $ABCDEFGH$ with side lengths $AB = CD = EF = GH = 10$ and $BC=  DE = FG = HA = 11$ is formed by removing four $6-8-10$ triangles from the corners of a $23\times 27$ rectangle with side $\overline{AH}$ on a short side of the rectangle, as shown. Let $J$ be the midpoint of $\overline{HA}$,  and partition the octagon into $7$ triangles by drawing segments $\overline{JB}$,  $\overline{JC}$,  $\overline{JD}$,  $\overline{JE}$,  $\overline{JF}$,  and $\overline{JG}$. Find the area of the convex polygon whose vertices are the centroids of these $7$ triangles.$A$
