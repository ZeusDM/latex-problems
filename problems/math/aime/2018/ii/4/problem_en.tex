In equiangular octagon $CAROLINE$,  $CA = RO = LI = NE = \sqrt{2}$ and $AR = OL = IN = EC = 1$. The self-intersecting octagon $CORNELIA$ encloses six non-overlapping triangular regions. Let $K$ be the area enclosed by $CORNELIA$,  that is, that total area of the six triangular regions. Then $K=\tfrac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $a + b$.
