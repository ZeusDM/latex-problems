Circles $C_1$ and $C_2$ are externally tangent, and they are both internally tangent to circle $C_3$. The radii of $C_1$ and $C_2$ are $4$ and $10$, respectively, and the centers of the three circles are all collinear. A chord of $C_3$ is also a common external tangent of $C_1$ and $C_2$. Given that the length of the chord is $\frac{m\sqrt{n}}{p}$ where $m,n,$ and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $m+n+p$.
