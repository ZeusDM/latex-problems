The cards in a stack of $2n$ cards are numbered consecutively from $1$ through $2n$ from top to bottom. The top $n$ cards are removed, kept in order, and form pile $A$. The remaining cards form pile $B$. The cards are then restacked by taking cards alternately from the tops of pile $B$ and $A$, respectively. In this process, card number $(n+1)$ becomes the bottom card of the new stack, card number $1$ is on top of this card, and so on, until piles $A$ and $B$ are exhausted. If, after the restacking process, at least one card from each pile occupies the same position that it occupied in the original stack, the stack is named \textit{magical}. Find the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number $131$ retains its original position.
