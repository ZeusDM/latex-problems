Let $w_{1}$ and $w_{2}$ denote the circles $x^{2}+y^{2}+10x-24y-87=0$ and $x^{2}+y^{2}-10x-24y+153=0$, respectively. Let $m$ be the smallest positive value of $a$ for which the line $y=ax$ contains the center of a circle that is externally tangent to $w_{2}$ and internally tangent to $w_{1}$. Given that $m^{2}=p/q$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime integers, find $p+q$.
