Twenty seven unit cubes are painted orange on a set of four faces so that two non-painted faces share an edge. The $27$ cubes are randomly arranged to form a $3\times 3 \times 3$ cube. Given the probability of the entire surface area of the larger cube is orange is $\frac{p^a}{q^br^c},$ where $p$,$q$, and $r$ are distinct primes and $a$,$b$, and $c$ are positive integers, find $a+b+c+p+q+r$.
