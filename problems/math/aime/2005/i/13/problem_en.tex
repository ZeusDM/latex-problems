A particle moves in the Cartesian Plane according to the following rules:

1.  From any lattice point $ (a,b)$, the particle may only move to $ (a + 1,b)$, $ (a,b + 1)$, or $ (a + 1,b + 1)$.
2. There are no right angle turns in the particle's path.

How many different paths can the particle take from $ (0,0)$ to $ (5,5)$?
