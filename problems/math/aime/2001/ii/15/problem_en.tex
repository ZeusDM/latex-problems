Let $EFGH$, $EFDC$, and $EHBC$ be three adjacent square faces of a cube, for which $EC=8$, and let $A$ be the eighth vertex of the cube. Let $I$, $J$, and $K$, be the points on $\overline{EF}$, $\overline{EH}$, and $\overline{EC}$, respectively, so that $EI=EJ=EK=2$. A solid $S$ is obtained by drilling a tunnel through the cube. The sides of the tunnel are planes parallel to $\overline{AE}$, and containing the edges, $\overline{IJ}$, $\overline{JK}$, and $\overline{KI}$. The surface area of $S$, including the walls of the tunnel, is $m+n\sqrt{p}$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers and $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.
