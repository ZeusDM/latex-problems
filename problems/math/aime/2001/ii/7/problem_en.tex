Let $\triangle{PQR}$ be a right triangle with $PQ=90$, $PR=120$, and $QR=150$. Let $C_{1}$ be the inscribed circle. Construct $\overline{ST}$ with $S$ on $\overline{PR}$ and $T$ on $\overline{QR}$, such that $\overline{ST}$ is perpendicular to $\overline{PR}$ and tangent to $C_{1}$. Construct $\overline{UV}$ with $U$ on $\overline{PQ}$ and $V$ on $\overline{QR}$ such that $\overline{UV}$ is perpendicular to $\overline{PQ}$ and tangent to $C_{1}$. Let $C_{2}$ be the inscribed circle of $\triangle{RST}$ and $C_{3}$ the inscribed circle of $\triangle{QUV}$. The distance between the centers of $C_{2}$ and $C_{3}$ can be written as $\sqrt{10n}$. What is $n$?
