There are $2n$ complex numbers that satisfy both $z^{28}-z^{8}-1=0$ and $|z|=1$. These numbers have the form $z_{m}=\cos\theta_{m}+i\sin\theta_{m}$, where $0\leq\theta_{1}<\theta_{2}< \dots <\theta_{2n}<360$ and angles are measured in degrees. Find the value of $\theta_{2}+\theta_{4}+\dots+\theta_{2n}$.
