Square $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle. Square $EFGH$ has vertices $E$ and $F$ on $\overline{CD}$ and vertices $G$ and $H$ on the circle. The ratio of the area of square $EFGH$ to the area of square $ABCD$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers and $m<n$. Find $10n+m$.
