A set of positive numbers has the $\text{triangle property}$ if it has three distinct elements that are the lengths of the sides of a triangle whose area is positive. Consider sets $\{4, 5, 6, \ldots, n\}$ of consecutive positive integers, all of whose ten-element subsets have the triangle property. What is the largest possible value of $n$?
