Triangle $ABC$ has $AB=21$, $AC=22$, and $BC=20$.  Points $D$ and $E$ are located on $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$, respectively, such that $\overline{DE}$ is parallel to $\overline{BC}$ and contains the center of the inscribed circle of triangle $ABC$.  Then $DE=m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m+n$.
