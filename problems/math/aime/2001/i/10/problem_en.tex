Let $S$ be the set of points whose coordinates $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are integers that satisfy $0\le x\le2,$ $0\le y\le3,$ and $0\le z\le4.$  Two distinct points are randomly chosen from $S.$  The probability that the midpoint of the segment they determine also belongs to $S$ is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m+n.$
