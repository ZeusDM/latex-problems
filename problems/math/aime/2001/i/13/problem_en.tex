In a certain circle, the chord of a $d$-degree arc is 22 centimeters long, and the chord of a $2d$-degree arc is 20 centimeters longer than the chord of a $3d$-degree arc, where $d<120.$  The length of the chord of a $3d$-degree arc is $-m+\sqrt{n}$ centimeters, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers.  Find $m+n.$
