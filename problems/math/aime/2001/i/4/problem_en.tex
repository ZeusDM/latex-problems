In triangle $ABC$, angles $A$ and $B$ measure 60 degrees and 45 degrees, respectively.  The bisector of angle $A$ intersects $\overline{BC}$ at $T$, and $AT=24.$  The area of triangle $ABC$ can be written in the form $a+b\sqrt{c},$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b+c.$
