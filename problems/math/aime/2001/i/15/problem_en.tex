The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are randomly written on the faces of a regular octahedron so that each face contains a different number.  The probability that no two consecutive numbers, where 8 and 1 are considered to be consecutive, are written on faces that share an edge is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m+n.$
