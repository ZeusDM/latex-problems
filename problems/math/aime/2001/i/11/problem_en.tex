In a rectangular array of points, with 5 rows and $N$ columns, the points are numbered consecutively from left to right beginning with the top row.  Thus the top row is numbered 1 through $N,$ the second row is numbered $N+1$ through $2N,$ and so forth.  Five points, $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4,$ and $P_5,$ are selected so that each $P_i$ is in row $i.$  Let $x_i$ be the number associated with $P_i.$  Now renumber the array consecutively from top to bottom, beginning with the first column.  Let $y_i$ be the number associated with $P_i$ after the renumbering.  It is found that $x_1=y_2,$ $x_2=y_1,$ $x_3=y_4,$ $x_4=y_5,$ and $x_5=y_3.$  Find the smallest possible value of $N.$
