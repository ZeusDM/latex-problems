In triangle $ABC$, $AB=13,$ $BC=15$ and $CA=17.$  Point $D$ is on $\overline{AB},$ $E$ is on $\overline{BC},$ and $F$ is on $\overline{CA}.$  Let $AD=p\cdot AB,$ $BE=q\cdot BC,$ and $CF=r\cdot CA,$ where $p,$ $q,$ and $r$ are positive and satisfy $p+q+r=2/3$ and $p^2+q^2+r^2=2/5.$  The ratio of the area of triangle $DEF$ to the area of triangle $ABC$ can be written in the form $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m+n.$
