Triangle $ ABC$ has $ AC = 450$ and $ BC = 300$. Points $ K$ and $ L$ are located on $ \overline{AC}$ and $ \overline{AB}$ respectively so that $ AK = CK$, and $ \overline{CL}$ is the angle bisector of angle $ C$. Let $ P$ be the point of intersection of $ \overline{BK}$ and $ \overline{CL}$, and let $ M$ be the point on line $ BK$ for which $ K$ is the midpoint of $ \overline{PM}$. If $ AM = 180$, find $ LP$.
