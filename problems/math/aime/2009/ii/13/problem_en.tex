Let $ A$ and $ B$ be the endpoints of a semicircular arc of radius $ 2$. The arc is divided into seven congruent arcs by six equally spaced points $ C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_6$. All chords of the form $ \overline{AC_i}$ or $ \overline{BC_i}$ are drawn. Let $ n$ be the product of the lengths of these twelve chords. Find the remainder when $ n$ is divided by $ 1000$.
