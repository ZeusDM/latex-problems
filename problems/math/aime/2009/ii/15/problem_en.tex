Let $ \overline{MN}$ be a diameter of a circle with diameter $ 1$. Let $ A$ and $ B$ be points on one of the semicircular arcs determined by $ \overline{MN}$ such that $ A$ is the midpoint of the semicircle and $ MB=\frac35$. Point $ C$ lies on the other semicircular arc. Let $ d$ be the length of the line segment whose endpoints are the intersections of diameter $ \overline{MN}$ with the chords $ \overline{AC}$ and $ \overline{BC}$. The largest possible value of $ d$ can be written in the form $ r-s\sqrt{t}$, where $ r$, $ s$, and $ t$ are positive integers and $ t$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $ r+s+t$.
