Four lighthouses are located at points $ A$, $ B$, $ C$, and $ D$. The lighthouse at $ A$ is $ 5$ kilometers from the lighthouse at $ B$, the lighthouse at $ B$ is $ 12$ kilometers from the lighthouse at $ C$, and the lighthouse at $ A$ is $ 13$ kilometers from the lighthouse at $ C$. To an observer at $ A$, the angle determined by the lights at $ B$ and $ D$ and the angle determined by the lights at $ C$ and $ D$ are equal. To an observer at $ C$, the angle determined by the lights at $ A$ and $ B$ and the angle determined by the lights at $ D$ and $ B$ are equal. The number of kilometers from $ A$ to $ D$ is given by $ \displaystyle\frac{p\sqrt{r}}{q}$, where $ p$, $ q$, and $ r$ are relatively prime positive integers, and $ r$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $ p+q+r$,
