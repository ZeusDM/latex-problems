Dave rolls a fair six-sided die until a six appears for the first time. Independently, Linda rolls a fair six-sided die until a six appears for the first time. Let $ m$ and $ n$ be relatively prime positive integers such that $ \frac{m}{n}$ is the probability that the number of times Dave rolls his die is equal to or within one of the number of times Linda rolls her die. Find $ m+n$.
