In triangle $ ABC$ the medians $ \overline{AD}$ and $ \overline{CE}$ have lengths 18 and 27, respectively, and $ AB = 24$.  Extend $ \overline{CE}$ to intersect the circumcircle of $ ABC$ at $ F$.  The area of triangle $ AFB$ is $ m\sqrt {n}$, where $ m$ and $ n$ are positive integers and $ n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $ m + n$.
