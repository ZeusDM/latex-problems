Let $ABCD$ and $BCFG$ be two faces of a cube with $AB=12.$  A beam of light emanates from vertex $A$ and reflects off face $BCFG$ at point $P,$ which is 7 units from $\overline{BG}$ and 5 units from $\overline{BC}.$  The beam continues to be reflected off the faces of the cube.  The length of the light path from the time it leaves point $A$ until it next reaches a vertex of the cube is given by $m\sqrt{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $m+n.$
