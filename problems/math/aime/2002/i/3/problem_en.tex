Jane is 25 years old.  Dick is older than Jane.  In $n$ years, where $n$ is a positive integer, Dick's age and Jane's age will both be two-digit number and will have the property that Jane's age is obtained by interchanging the digits of Dick's age.  Let $d$ be Dick's present age.  How many ordered pairs of positive integers $(d,n)$ are possible?
