Polyhedron $ABCDEFG$ has six faces.  Face $ABCD$ is a square with $AB=12;$ face $ABFG$ is a trapezoid with $\overline{AB}$ parallel to $\overline{GF},$ $BF=AG=8,$ and $GF=6;$ and face $CDE$ has $CE=DE=14.$  The other three faces are $ADEG, BCEF,$ and $EFG.$  The distance from $E$ to face $ABCD$ is 12.  Given that $EG^2=p-q\sqrt{r},$ where $p, q,$ and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $p+q+r.$
