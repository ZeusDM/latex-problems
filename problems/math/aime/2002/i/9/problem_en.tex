Harold, Tanya, and Ulysses paint a very long picket fence.
Harold starts with the first picket and paints every $h$th picket;
Tanya starts with the second picket and paints everth $t$th picket; and
Ulysses starts with the third picket and paints every $u$th picket.
Call the positive integer $100h+10t+u$ $\textit{paintable}$ when the triple $(h,t,u)$ of positive integers results in every picket being painted exaclty once.  Find the sum of all the paintable integers.
