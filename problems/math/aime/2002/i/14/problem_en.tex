A set $\mathcal{S}$ of distinct positive integers has the following property: for every integer $x$ in $\mathcal{S},$ the arithmetic mean of the set of values obtained by deleting $x$ from $\mathcal{S}$ is an integer.  Given that 1 belongs to $\mathcal{S}$ and that 2002 is the largest element of $\mathcal{S},$ what is the greatet number of elements that $\mathcal{S}$ can have?
