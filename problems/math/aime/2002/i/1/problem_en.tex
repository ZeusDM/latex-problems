Many states use a sequence of three letters followed by a sequence of three digits as their standard license-plate pattern.  Given that each three-letter three-digit arrangement is equally likely, the probability that such a license plate will contain at least one palindrome (a three-letter arrangement or a three-digit arrangement that reads the same left-to-right as it does right-to-left) is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m+n$.
