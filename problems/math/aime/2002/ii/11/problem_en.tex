Two distinct, real, infinite geometric series each have a sum of $1$ and have the same second term. The third term of one of the series is $1/8,$ and the second term of both series can be written in the form $\frac{\sqrt{m}-n}{p},$ where $m,$ $n,$ and $p$ are positive integers and $m$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $100m+10n+p.$
