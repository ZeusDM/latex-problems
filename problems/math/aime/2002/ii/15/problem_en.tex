Circles $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{2}$ intersect at two points, one of which is $(9,6),$ and the product of the radii is $68.$ The x-axis and the line $y=mx$, where $m>0,$ are tangent to both circles. It is given that $m$ can be written in the form $a\sqrt{b}/c,$ where $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, and $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime. Find $a+b+c.$
