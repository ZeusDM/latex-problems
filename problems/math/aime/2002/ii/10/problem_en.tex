While finding the sine of a certain angle, an absent-minded professor failed to notice that his calculator was not in the correct angular mode. He was lucky to get the right answer. The two least positive real values of $x$ for which the sine of $x$ degrees is the same as the sine of $x$ radians are $\frac{m\pi}{n-\pi}$ and $\frac{p\pi}{q+\pi},$ where $m,$ $n,$ $p$ and $q$ are positive integers. Find $m+n+p+q.$
