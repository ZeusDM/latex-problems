Patio blocks that are hexagons $1$ unit on a side are used to outline a garden by placing the blocks edge to edge with $n$ on each side. The diagram indicates the path of blocks around the garden when $n=5.$

If $n=202,$ then the area of the garden enclosed by the path, not including the path itself, is $m(\sqrt{3}/2)$ square units, where $m$ is a positive integer. Find the remainder when $m$ is divided by $1000.$
