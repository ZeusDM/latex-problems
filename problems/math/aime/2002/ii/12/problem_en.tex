A basketball player has a constant probability of $.4$ of making any given shot, independent of previous shots. Let $a_{n}$ be the ratio of shots made to shots attempted after $n$ shots. The probability that $a_{10}=.4$ and $a_{n}\le .4$ for all $n$ such that $1\le n \le 9$ is given to be $p^{a}q^{b}r/(s^{c}),$ where $p,$ $q,$ $r,$ and $s$ are primes, and $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ are positive integers. Find $(p+q+r+s)(a+b+c).$
