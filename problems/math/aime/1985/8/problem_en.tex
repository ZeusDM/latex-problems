The sum of the following seven numbers is exactly 19:
\[a_1=2.56,\qquad a_2=2.61,\qquad a_3=2.65,\qquad a_4=2.71,\]\[a_5=2.79,\qquad a_6=2.82,\qquad a_7=2.86.\]It is desired to replace each $a_i$ by an integer approximation $A_i$, $1 \le i \le 7$, so that the sum of the $A_i$'s is also 19 and so that $M$, the maximum of the "errors" $|A_i - a_i|$, is as small as possible.  For this minimum $M$, what is $100M$?
