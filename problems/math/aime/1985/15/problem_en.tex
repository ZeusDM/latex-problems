Three 12 cm $\times$ 12 cm squares are each cut into two pieces $A$ and $B$, as shown in the first figure below, by joining the midpoints of two adjacent sides.  These six pieces are then attached to a regular hexagon, as shown in the second figure, so as to fold into a polyhedron.  What is the volume (in $\text{cm}^3$) of this polyhedron?
