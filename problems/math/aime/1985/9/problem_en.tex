In a circle, parallel chords of lengths 2, 3, and 4 determine central angles of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\alpha + \beta$ radians, respectively, where $\alpha + \beta < \pi$.  If $\cos \alpha$, which is a positive rational number, is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of its numerator and denominator?
