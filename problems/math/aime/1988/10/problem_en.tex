A convex polyhedron has for its faces 12 squares, 8 regular hexagons, and 6 regular octagons.  At each vertex of the polyhedron one square, one hexagon, and one octagon meet.  How many segments joining vertices of the polyhedron lie in the interior of the polyhedron rather than along an edge or a face?
