Equilateral $\triangle ABC$ is inscribed in a circle of radius 2. Extend $\overline{AB}$ through $B$ to point $D$ so that $AD=13$, and extend $\overline{AC}$ through $C$ to point $E$ so that $AE=11$. Through $D$, draw a line $l_1$ parallel to $\overline{AE}$, and through $E$, draw a line ${l}_2$ parallel to $\overline{AD}$. Let $F$ be the intersection of ${l}_1$ and ${l}_2$. Let $G$ be the point on the circle that is collinear with $A$ and $F$ and distinct from $A$. Given that the area of $\triangle CBG$ can be expressed in the form $\frac{p\sqrt{q}}{r}$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are positive integers, $p$ and $r$ are relatively prime, and $q$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $p+q+r$.
