Seven teams play a soccer tournament in which each team plays every other team exactly once. No ties occur, each team has a $50\%$ chance of winning each game it plays, and the outcomes of the games are independent. In each game, the winner is awarded a point and the loser gets 0 points. The total points are accumilated to decide the ranks of the teams. In the first game of the tournament, team $A$ beats team $B$. The probability that team $A$ finishes with more points than team $B$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
