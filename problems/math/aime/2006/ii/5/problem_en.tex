When rolling a certain unfair six-sided die with faces numbered $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$, and $6$, the probability of obtaining face $F$ is greater than $\frac{1}{6}$, the probability of obtaining the face opposite is less than $\frac{1}{6}$, the probability of obtaining any one of the other four faces is $\frac{1}{6}$, and the sum of the numbers on opposite faces is $7$. When two such dice are rolled, the probability of obtaining a sum of $7$ is $\frac{47}{288}$. Given that the probability of obtaining face $F$ is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.
