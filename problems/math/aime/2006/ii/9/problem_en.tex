Circles $\mathcal{C}_1$, $\mathcal{C}_2$, and $\mathcal{C}_3$ have their centers at (0,0), (12,0), and (24,0), and have radii 1, 2, and 4, respectively. Line $t_1$ is a common internal tangent to $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ and has a positive slope, and line $t_2$ is a common internal tangent to $\mathcal{C}_2$ and $\mathcal{C}_3$ and has a negative slope. Given that lines $t_1$ and $t_2$ intersect at $(x,y)$, and that $x=p-q\sqrt{r}$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are positive integers and $r$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $p+q+r$.
