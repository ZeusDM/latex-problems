A collection of 8 cubes consists of one cube with edge-length $k$ for each integer $k,\thinspace 1 \le k \le 8.$  A tower is to be built using all 8 cubes according to the rules:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Any cube may be the bottom cube in the tower.
	\item The cube immediately on top of a cube with edge-length $k$ must have edge-length at most $k+2$.
\end{itemize}

Let $T$ be the number of different towers than can be constructed.  What is the remainder when $T$ is divided by 1000?
