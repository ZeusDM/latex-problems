A tripod has three legs each of length 5 feet.  When the tripod is set up, the angle between any pair of legs is equal to the angle between any other pair, and the top of the tripod is 4 feet from the ground.  In setting up the tripod, the lower 1 foot of one leg breaks off.  Let $h$ be the height in feet of the top of the tripod from the ground when the broken tripod is set up.  Then $h$ can be written in the form $\frac m{\sqrt{n}},$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $\lfloor m+\sqrt{n}\rfloor.$  (The notation $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $x$.)
