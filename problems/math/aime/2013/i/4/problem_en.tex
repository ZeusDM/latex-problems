In the array of $13$ squares shown below, $8$ squares are colored red, and the remaining $5$ squares are colored blue. If one of all possible such colorings is chosen at random, the probability that the chosen colored array appears the same when rotated $90^{\circ}$ around the central square is $\tfrac{1}{n}$, where $n$ is a positive integer. Find $n$.
