Let $ABCD$ be a square, and let $E$ and $F$ be points on $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{BC}$, respectively. The line through $E$ parallel to $\overline{BC}$ and the line through $F$ parallel to $\overline{AB}$ divide $ABCD$ into two squares and two non square rectangles. The sum of the areas of the two squares is $\frac{9}{10}$ of the area of square $ABCD$. Find $\frac{AE}{EB} + \frac{EB}{AE}$.
