Let $\triangle PQR$ be a triangle with $\angle P = 75^\circ$ and $\angle Q = 60^\circ$. A regular hexagon $ABCDEF$ with side length 1 is drawn inside $\triangle PQR$ so that side $\overline{AB}$ lies on $\overline{PQ}$, side $\overline{CD}$ lies on $\overline{QR}$, and one of the remaining vertices lies on $\overline{RP}$. There are positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ such that the area of $\triangle PQR$ can be expressed in the form $\tfrac{a+b\sqrt c}d$, where $a$ and $d$ are relatively prime and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c+d$.
