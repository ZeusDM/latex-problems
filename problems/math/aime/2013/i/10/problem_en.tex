There are nonzero integers $a$, $b$, $r$, and $s$ such that the complex number $r+si$ is a zero of the polynomial $P(x) = x^3 - ax^2 + bx - 65$. For each possible combination of $a$ and $b$, let $p_{a,b}$ be the sum of the zeroes of $P(x)$. Find the sum of the $p_{a,b}$'s for all possible combinations of $a$ and $b$.
