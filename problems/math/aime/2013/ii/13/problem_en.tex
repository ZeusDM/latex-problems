In $\triangle ABC$, $AC = BC$, and point $D$ is on $\overline{BC}$ so that $CD = 3 \cdot BD$.  Let $E$ be the midpoint of $\overline{AD}$.  Given that $CE = \sqrt{7}$ and $BE = 3$, the area of $\triangle ABC$ can be expressed in the form $m\sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $m+n$.
