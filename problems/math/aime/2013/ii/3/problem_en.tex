A large candle is $119$ centimeters tall.  It is designed to burn down more quickly when it is first lit and more slowly as it approaches its bottom.  Specifically, the candle takes $10$ seconds to burn down the first centimeter from the top, $20$ seconds to burn down the second centimeter, and $10k$ seconds to burn down the $k$-th centimeter.  Suppose it takes $T$ seconds for the candle to burn down completely.  Then $\tfrac{T}{2}$ seconds after it is lit, the candle's height in centimeters will be $h$.  Find $10h$.
