In the Cartesian plane let $A = (1,0)$ and $B = \left( 2, 2\sqrt{3} \right)$.  Equilateral triangle $ABC$ is constructed so that $C$ lies in the first quadrant.  Let $P=(x,y)$ be the center of $\triangle ABC$.  Then $x \cdot y$ can be written as $\tfrac{p\sqrt{q}}{r}$, where $p$ and $r$ are relatively prime positive integers and $q$ is an integer that is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $p+q+r$.
