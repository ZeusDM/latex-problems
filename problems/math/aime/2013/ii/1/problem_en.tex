Suppose that the measurement of time during the day is converted to the metric system so that each day has $10$ metric hours, and each metric hour has $100$ metric minutes.  Digital clocks would then be produced that would read $9{:}99$ just before midnight, $0{:}00$ at midnight, $1{:}25$ at the former $3{:}00$ $\textsc{am}$, and $7{:}50$ at the former $6{:}00$ $\textsc{pm}$.  After the conversion, a person who wanted to wake up at the equivalent of the former $6{:}36$ $\textsc{am}$ would have to set his new digital alarm clock for $\text{A:BC}$, where $\text{A}$, $\text{B}$, and $\text{C}$ are digits.  Find $100\text{A} + 10\text{B} + \text{C}$.
