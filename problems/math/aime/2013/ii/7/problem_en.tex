A group of clerks is assigned the task of sorting $1775$ files.  Each clerk sorts at a constant rate of $30$ files per hour.  At the end of the first hour, some of the clerks are reassigned to another task; at the end of the second hour, the same number of the remaining clerks are also reassigned to another task, and a similar reassignment occurs at the end of the third hour.  The group finishes the sorting in $3$ hours and $10$ minutes.  Find the number of files sorted during the first one and a half hours of sorting.
