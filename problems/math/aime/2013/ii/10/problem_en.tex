Given a circle of radius $\sqrt{13}$, let $A$ be a point at a distance $4 + \sqrt{13}$ from the center $O$ of the circle.  Let $B$ be the point on the circle nearest to point $A$.  A line passing through the point $A$ intersects the circle at points $K$ and $L$.  The maximum possible area for $\triangle BKL$ can be written in the form $\tfrac{a-b\sqrt{c}}{d}$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are positive integers, $a$ and $d$ are relatively prime, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b+c+d$.
