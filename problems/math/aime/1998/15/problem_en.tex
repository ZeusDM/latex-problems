Define a domino to be an ordered pair of distinct positive integers.  A proper sequence of dominos is a list of distinct dominos in which the first coordinate of each pair after the first equals the second coordinate of the immediately preceding pair, and in which $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$ do not both appear for any $i$ and $j.$  Let $D_{40}$ be the set of all dominos whose coordinates are no larger than 40.  Find the length of the longest proper sequence of dominos that can be formed using the dominos of $D_{40}.$
