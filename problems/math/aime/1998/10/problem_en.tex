Eight spheres of radius 100 are placed on a flat surface so that each sphere is tangent to two others and their centers are the vertices of a regular octagon.  A ninth sphere is placed on the flat surface so that it is tangent to each of the other eight spheres.  The radius of this last sphere is $a+b\sqrt{c},$ where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b+c.$
