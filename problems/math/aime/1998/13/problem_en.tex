If $\{a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots,a_n\}$ is a set of real numbers, indexed so that $a_1<a_2<a_3<\cdots<a_n,$ its complex power sum is defined to be $a_1i+a_2i^2+a_3i^3+\cdots+a_ni^n,$ where $i^2=-1.$  Let $S_n$ be the sum of the complex power sums of all nonempty subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}.$  Given that $S_8=-176-64i$ and $S_9=p+qi,$ were $p$ and $q$ are integers, find $|p|+|q|.$
