Three of the edges of a cube are $\overline{AB}, \overline{BC},$ and $\overline{CD},$ and $\overline{AD}$ is an interior diagonal.  Points $P, Q,$ and $R$ are on $\overline{AB}, \overline{BC},$ and $\overline{CD},$ respectively, so that $AP=5, PB=15, BQ=15,$ and $CR=10.$  What is the area of the polygon that is the intersection of plane $PQR$ and the cube?
