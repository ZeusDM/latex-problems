Two mathematicians take a morning coffee break each day.  They arrive at the cafeteria independently, at random times between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., and stay for exactly $m$ mintues.  The probability that either one arrives while the other is in the cafeteria is $40 \%,$ and $m=a-b\sqrt{c},$ where $a, b,$ and $c$ are positive integers, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b+c.$
