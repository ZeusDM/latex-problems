Let $ABC$ be equilateral, and $D, E,$ and $F$ be the midpoints of $\overline{BC}, \overline{CA},$ and $\overline{AB},$ respectively.  There exist points $P, Q,$ and $R$ on $\overline{DE}, \overline{EF},$ and $\overline{FD},$ respectively, with the property that $P$ is on $\overline{CQ}, Q$ is on $\overline{AR},$ and $R$ is on $\overline{BP}.$  The ratio of the area of triangle $ABC$ to the area of triangle $PQR$ is $a+b\sqrt{c},$ where $a, b$ and $c$ are integers, and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  What is $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}$?
