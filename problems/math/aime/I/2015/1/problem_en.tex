The expressions $A=1\times2+3\times4+5\times6+\cdots+37\times38+39$ and $B=1+2\times3+4\times5+\cdots+36\times37+38\times39$ are obtained by writing multiplication and addition operators in an alternating pattern between successive integers. Find the positive difference between integers $A$ and $B$.
