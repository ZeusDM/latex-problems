Jenn randomly chooses a number $J$ from $1,2,3,\ldots,19,20$. Bela then randomly chooses a number $B$ from $1,2,3,\ldots,19,20$ distinct from $J$. The value of $B-J$ is at least $2$ with a probability that can be expressed in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
