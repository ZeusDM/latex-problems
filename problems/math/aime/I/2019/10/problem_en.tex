For distinct complex numbers $z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_{673}$, the polynomial \[\left(x-z_1\right)^3\left(x-z_2\right)^3\cdots\left(x-z_{673}\right)^3\] can be expressed as $x^{2019}+20x^{2018}+19x^{2017}+g\left(x\right)$, where $g\left(x\right)$ is a polynomial with complex coefficients and with degree at most $2016$. The value of \[\left|\displaystyle\sum_{1\leq j<k\leq673}z_jz_j\right|\] can be expressed in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
