There are positive integers $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the system of equations
\begin{align*}
	\log_{10}x+2\log_{10}\left(\gcd\left(x,y\right)\right)&=60\\
	\log_{10}y+2\log_{10}\left(\lcm\left(x,y\right)\right)&=570.
\end{align*}
Let $m$ be the number of (not necessarily distinct) prime factors in the prime factorization of $x$, and let $n$ be the number of (not necessarily distinct) prime factors in the prime factorization of $y$. Find $3m+2n$.
