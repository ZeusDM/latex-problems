Given $f\left(z\right)=z^2-19z$, there are complex numbers $z$ with the property that $z$, $f\left(z\right)$, and $f\left(f\left(z\right)\right)$ are the vertices of a right triangle in the complex plane with a right angle at $f\left(z\right)$. There are positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that one such value of $z$ is $m+\sqrt{n}+11i$. Find $m+n$.
