In $\triangle{ABC}$, the sides have integer lengths and $AB=AC$. Circle $\omega$ has its center at the incenter of $\triangle{ABC}$. An \emph{excircle} of $\triangle{ABC}$ is a circle in the exterior of $\triangle{ABC}$ that is tangent to one side of the triangle and tangent to the extensions of the other two sides. Suppose that the excircle tangent to $\overline{BC}$ is internally tangent to $\omega$, and the other two excircles are both externally tangent to $\omega$. Find the minimum possible value of the perimeter of $\triangle{ABC}$.
