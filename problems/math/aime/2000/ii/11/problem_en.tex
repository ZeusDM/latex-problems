The coordinates of the vertices of isosceles trapezoid $ABCD$ are all integers, with $A=(20,100)$ and $D=(21,107).$  The trapezoid has no horizontal or vertical sides, and $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ are the only parallel sides.  The sum o f the absolute values of all possible slopes for $\overline{AB}$ is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m+n.$
