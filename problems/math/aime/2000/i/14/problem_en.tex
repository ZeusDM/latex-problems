In triangle $ABC,$ it is given that angles $B$ and $C$ are congruent. Points $P$ and $Q$ lie on $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{AB},$ respectively, so that $AP=PQ=QB=BC.$ Angle $ACB$ is $r$ times as large as angle $APQ,$ where $r$ is a positive real number. Find the greatest integer that does not exceed $1000r.$
