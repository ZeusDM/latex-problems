A sequence of numbers $x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},\ldots,x_{100}$ has the property that, for every integer $k$ between $1$ and $100,$ inclusive, the number $x_{k}$ is $k$ less than the sum of the other $99$ numbers. Given that $x_{50}=m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n.$
