Point $D$ lies on side $BC$ of $\triangle ABC$ so that $\overline{AD}$ bisects $\angle BAC$. The perpendicular bisector of $\overline{AD}$ intersects the bisectors of $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ACB$ in points $E$ and $F$, respectively. Given that $AB=4$, $BC=5$, $CA=6$, the area of $\triangle AEF$ can be written as $\tfrac{m\sqrt n}p$, where $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime positive integers, and $n$ is a positive integer not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.
