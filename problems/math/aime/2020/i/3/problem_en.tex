A positive integer $N$ has base-eleven representation $\underline{a}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}$ and base-eight representation $\underline{1}\,\underline{b}\,\underline{c}\,\underline{a}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent (not necessarily distinct) digits. Find the least such $N$ expressed in base ten.
