Let $S$ be the set of positive integer divisors of $20^9.$ Three numbers are chosen independently and at random from the set $S$ and labeled $a_1,a_2,$ and $a_3$ in the order they are chosen. The probability that both $a_1$ divides $a_2$ and $a_2$ divides $a_3$ is $\frac mn,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m.$
