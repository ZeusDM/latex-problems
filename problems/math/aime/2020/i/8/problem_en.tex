A bug walks all day and sleeps all night. On the first day, it starts at point $O$, faces east, and walks a distance of 5 units due east. Each night the bug rotates $60 ^\circ$ counterclockwise. Each day it walks in this new direction half as far as it walked the previous day. The bug gets arbitrarily close to point $P$. Then $OP^2 = \frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.
