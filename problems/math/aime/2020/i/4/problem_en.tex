Let $S$ be the set of positive integers $N$ with the property that the last four digits of $N$ are $2020$, and when the last four digits are removed, the result is a divisor of $N$. For example, $42,020$ is in $S$ because $4$ is a divisor of $42,020$. Find the sum of all the digits of all the numbers in $S$. For example, the number $42,020$ contributes $4+2+0+2+0=8$ to this total.
