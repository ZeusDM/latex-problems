In $\triangle ABC$ with $AB=AC$, point $D$ lies strictly between $A$ and $C$ on side $\overline{AC}$, and point $E$ lies strictly between $A$ and $B$ on side $\overline{AB}$ such that $AE=ED=DB=BC$. The degree measure of $\angle ABC$ is $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
