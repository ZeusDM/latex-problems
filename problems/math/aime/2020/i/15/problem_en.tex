Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with circumcircle $\omega$ and orthocenter $H$. Suppose the tangent to the circumcircle of $\triangle HBC$ at $H$ intersects $\omega$ at points $X$ and $Y$ with $HA=3$, $HX=2$, $HY=6$. The area of $\triangle ABC$ can be written as $m\sqrt n$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.
