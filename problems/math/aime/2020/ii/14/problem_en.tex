For real number $x$ let $\lfloor x\rfloor$ be the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, and define $\{x\}=x-\lfloor x\rfloor$ to be the fractional part of $x$. For example, $\{3\}=0$ and $\{4.56\}=0.56$. Define $f(x)=x\{x\}$, and let $N$ be the number of real-valued solutions to the equation $f(f(f(x)))=17$ for $0\leq x\leq 2020$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
