For each positive integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the sum of the digits in the base-four representation of $n$ and let $g(n)$ be the sum of the digits in the base-eight representation of $f(n)$. For example, $f(2020) = f(133210_\text{four}) = 10 = 12_\text{eight}$, and $g(2020) = \text{the digit sum of } 12_\text{eight} = 3$. Let $N$ be the least value of $n$ such that the base-sixteen representation of $g(n)$ cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$
