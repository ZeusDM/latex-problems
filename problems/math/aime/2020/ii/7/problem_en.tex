Two congruent right circular cones each with base radius $3$ and height $8$ have axes of symmetry that intersect at right angles at a point in the interior of the cones a distance $3$ from the base of each cone. A sphere with radius $r$ lies inside both cones. The maximum possible value for $r^2$ is $\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
