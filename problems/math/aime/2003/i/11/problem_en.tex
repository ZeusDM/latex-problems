An angle $x$ is chosen at random from the interval $0^\circ < x < 90^\circ$.  Let $p$ be the probability that the numbers $\sin^2 x$, $\cos^2 x$, and $\sin x \cos x$ are not the lengths of the sides of a triangle.  Given that $p = d/n$, where $d$ is the number of degrees in $\arctan m$ and $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $m + n < 1000$, find $m + n$.
