In triangle $ABC,$ $AB=13,$ $BC=14,$ $AC=15,$ and point $G$ is the intersection of the medians. Points $A',$ $B',$ and $C',$ are the images of $A,$ $B,$ and $C,$ respectively, after a $180^\circ$ rotation about $G.$ What is the area if the union of the two regions enclosed by the triangles $ABC$ and $A'B'C'?$
