Triangle $ABC$ is a right triangle with $AC=7,$ $BC=24,$ and right angle at $C.$ Point $M$ is the midpoint of $AB,$ and $D$ is on the same side of line $AB$ as $C$ so that $AD=BD=15.$ Given that the area of triangle $CDM$ may be expressed as $\frac{m\sqrt{n}}{p},$ where $m,$ $n,$ and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $p$ are relatively prime, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $m+n+p.$
