Let
\[P(x)=24x^{24}+\sum_{j=1}^{23}(24-j)(x^{24-j}+x^{24+j}). \]
Let $z_{1},z_{2},\ldots,z_{r}$ be the distinct zeros of $P(x),$ and let $z_{K}^{2}=a_{k}+b_{k}i$ for $k=1,2,\ldots,r,$ where $i=\sqrt{-1},$ and $a_{k}$ and $b_{k}$ are real numbers. Let
\[\sum_{k=1}^{r}|b_{k}|=m+n\sqrt{p}, \]
where $m,$ $n,$ and $p$ are integers and $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p.$
