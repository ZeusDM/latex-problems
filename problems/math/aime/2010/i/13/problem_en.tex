Rectangle $ ABCD$ and a semicircle with diameter $ AB$ are coplanar and have nonoverlapping interiors. Let $ \mathcal{R}$ denote the region enclosed by the semicircle and the rectangle. Line $ \ell$ meets the semicircle, segment $ AB$, and segment $ CD$ at distinct points $ N$, $ U$, and $ T$, respectively. Line $ \ell$ divides region $ \mathcal{R}$ into two regions with areas in the ratio $ 1: 2$. Suppose that $ AU = 84$, $ AN = 126$, and $ UB = 168$. Then $ DA$ can be represented as $ m\sqrt {n}$, where $ m$ and $ n$ are positive integers and $ n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $ m + n$.
