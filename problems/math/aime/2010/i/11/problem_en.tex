Let $ \mathcal{R}$ be the region consisting of the set of points in the coordinate plane that satisfy both $ |8 - x| + y \le 10$ and $ 3y - x \ge 15$. When $ \mathcal{R}$ is revolved around the line whose equation is $ 3y - x = 15$, the volume of the resulting solid is $ \frac {m\pi}{n\sqrt {p}}$, where $ m$, $ n$, and $ p$ are positive integers, $ m$ and $ n$ are relatively prime, and $ p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $ m + n + p$.
