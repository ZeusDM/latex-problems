Define an ordered triple $ (A, B, C)$ of sets to be minimally intersecting if $ |A \cap B| = |B \cap C| = |C \cap A| = 1$ and $ A \cap B \cap C = \emptyset$. For example, $ (\{1,2\},\{2,3\},\{1,3,4\})$ is a minimally intersecting triple. Let $ N$ be the number of minimally intersecting ordered triples of sets for which each set is a subset of $ \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$. Find the remainder when $ N$ is divided by $ 1000$.

\textbf{Note}: $ |S|$ represents the number of elements in the set $ S$.
