Jackie and Phil have two fair coins and a third coin that comes up heads with probability $ \frac47$. Jackie flips the three coins, and then Phil flips the three coins. Let $ \frac{m}{n}$ be the probability that Jackie gets the same number of heads as Phil, where $ m$ and $ n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $ m + n$.
