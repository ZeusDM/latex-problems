For a real number $ a$, let $ \lfloor a \rfloor$ denominate the greatest integer less than or equal to $ a$. Let $ \mathcal{R}$ denote the region in the coordinate plane consisting of points $ (x,y)$ such that \[\lfloor x \rfloor ^2 + \lfloor y \rfloor ^2 = 25.\]The region $ \mathcal{R}$ is completely contained in a disk of radius $ r$ (a disk is the union of a circle and its interior). The minimum value of $ r$ can be written as $ \tfrac {\sqrt {m}}{n}$, where $ m$ and $ n$ are integers and $ m$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $ m + n$.
