Dave arrives at an airport which has twelve gates arranged in a straight line with exactly $ 100$ feet between adjacent gates. His departure gate is assigned at random. After waiting at that gate, Dave is told the departure gate has been changed to a different gate, again at random. Let the probability that Dave walks $ 400$ feet or less to the new gate be a fraction $ \frac{m}{n}$, where $ m$ and $ n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $ m+n$.
