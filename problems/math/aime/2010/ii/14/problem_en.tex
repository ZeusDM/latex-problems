In right triangle $ ABC$ with right angle at $ C$, $ \angle BAC < 45$ degrees and $ AB = 4$.  Point $ P$ on $ AB$ is chosen such that $ \angle APC = 2\angle ACP$ and $ CP = 1$.  The ratio $ \frac{AP}{BP}$ can be represented in the form $ p + q\sqrt{r}$, where $ p,q,r$ are positive integers and $ r$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $ p+q+r$.
