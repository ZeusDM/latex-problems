The $ 52$ cards in a deck are numbered $ 1, 2, \ldots, 52$. Alex, Blair, Corey, and Dylan each picks a card from the deck without replacement and with each card being equally likely to be picked, The two persons with lower numbered cards from a team, and the two persons with higher numbered cards form another team. Let $ p(a)$ be the probability that Alex and Dylan are on the same team, given that Alex picks one of the cards $ a$ and $ a+9$, and Dylan picks the other of these two cards. The minimum value of $ p(a)$ for which $ p(a)\ge\frac12$ can be written as $ \frac{m}{n}$. where $ m$ and $ n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $ m+n$.
