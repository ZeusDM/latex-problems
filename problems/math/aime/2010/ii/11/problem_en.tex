Define a \textit{T-grid} to be a $ 3\times3$ matrix which satisfies the following two properties:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Exactly five of the entries are $ 1$'s, and the remaining four entries are $ 0$'s.
	\item Among the eight rows, columns, and long diagonals (the long diagonals are $ \{a_{13},a_{22},a_{31}\}$ and $ \{a_{11},a_{22},a_{33}\}$, no more than one of the eight has all three entries equal.
\end{itemize}

Find the number of distinct T-grids.
