In $\triangle ABC$, the sides have integers lengths and $AB=AC$. Circle $\omega$ has its center at the incenter of $\triangle ABC$. An \textit{excircle} of $\triangle ABC$ is a circle in the exterior of $\triangle ABC$ that is tangent to one side of the triangle and tangent to the extensions of the other two sides. Suppose that the excircle tangent to $\overline{BC}$ is internally tangent to $\omega$, and the other two excircles are both externally tangent to $\omega$. Find the minimum possible value of the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$.
