Let $p$ be an odd prime dividing $2019^8+1$. Since $p$ divides $\Phi_{16}\left(2019\right)$, either $p\mid16$ or $16\mid p-1$. Clearly the former is impossible, so $p\equiv1\pmod{16}$.

Now, the first two primes that are $1\pmod{16}$ are $17$ and $97$. Check that \[2019^8+1\equiv13^8+1\equiv4^8+1\equiv16^4+1\equiv2\pmod{17}\] while
\begin{align*}
	2019^8+1&\equiv79^8+1\equiv18^8+1\equiv324^4+1\equiv33^4+1\\
	&\equiv1089^2+1\equiv22^2+1\equiv485\equiv0\pmod{97}
\end{align*}
so the answer is $\boxed{097}$ as desired.
