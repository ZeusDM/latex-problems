We compute the area of each of the triangles that are cut off. If $\theta$ is the included angle, then the area is $\frac{25}{2}\sin\theta$. So the area of the hexagon is \[150-\frac{25}{2}\left(\sin P+\sin Q+\sin R\right)=150-\frac{25}{2}\left(\frac{4}{5}+\frac{3}{5}+1\right)=\boxed{120}\] as desired.
