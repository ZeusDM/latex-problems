The total number of ways for them to choose numbers is $20\cdot19$. The total number of ways such that $B-J\geq2$ is \[\displaystyle\sum_{J=1}^{18}\displaystyle\sum_{B=J+2}^{20}1=\displaystyle\sum_{J=1}^{18}19-J=\frac{18\cdot19}{2}.\] So the probability that $B-J\geq2$ is $\frac{9}{20}$ yielding the answer of $\boxed{029}$.
