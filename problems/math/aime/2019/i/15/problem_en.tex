Let $\overline{AB}$ be a chord of circle $\omega$, and let $P$ be a point on chord $\overline{AB}$. Circle $\omega_1$ passes through $A$ and $P$ and is internally tangent to $\omega$. Circle $\omega_2$ passes through $B$ and $P$ and is internally tangent to $\omega$. Circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect at points $P$ and $Q$. Line $PQ$ intersects $\omega$ at $X$ and $Y$. Assume that $AP=5$, $PB=3$, $XY=11$, and $PQ^2=\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
