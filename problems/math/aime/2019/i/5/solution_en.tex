Call the steps $L$ for moving left, $D$ for moving down, and $X$ for moving left and down in one move. Note that the last step must be $X$ otherwise the second-to-last stop is on an axis already. Besides that, any combination of moves going from $\left(4,4\right)$ to $\left(1,1\right)$ suffices. So we can have any rearrangement of $LLLDDD$, $LLDDX$, $LDXX$, or $XXX$. Each of these happens with probability $\frac{1}{3^6}\binom{6}{3,3,0}$, $\frac{1}{3^6}\binom{5}{2,2,1}$, $\frac{1}{3^4}\binom{4}{1,1,2}$, and $\frac{1}{3^3}\binom{3}{0,0,3}$, respectively. So we add up and divide by $3$ to get \[\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{20}{3^6}+\frac{30}{3^5}+\frac{12}{3^4}+\frac{1}{3^3}\right)=\frac{245}{3^7}\] so the answer is $\boxed{252}$ as desired.
