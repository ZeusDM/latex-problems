A moving particle starts at the point $\left(4,4\right)$ and moves until it hits one of the coordinate axes for the first time. When the particle is at the point $\left(a,b\right)$, it moves at random to one of the points $\left(a-1,b\right)$, $\left(a,b-1\right)$, or $\left(a-1,b-1\right)$, each with probability $\frac{1}{3}$, independently of its previous moves. The probability that it will hit the coordinate axes at $\left(0,0\right)$ is $\frac{m}{3^n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $m$ is not divisible by $3$. Find $m+n$.
