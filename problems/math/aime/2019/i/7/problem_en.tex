There are positive integers $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the system of equations
\begin{align*}
\log_{10} x + 2 \log_{10} (\gcd(x,y)) &= 60 \\ \log_{10} y + 2 \log_{10} (\text{lcm}(x,y)) &= 570.
\end{align*}Let $m$ be the number of (not necessarily distinct) prime factors in the prime factorization of $x$, and let $n$ be the number of (not necessarily distinct) prime factors in the prime factorization of $y$. Find $3m+2n$.
