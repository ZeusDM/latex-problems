In a Martian civilization, all logarithms whose bases are not specified are assumed to be base $b$, for some fixed $b \geq 2$. A Martian student writes down
\begin{align*}3 \log(\sqrt{x}\log x) &= 56\\\log_{\log (x)}(x) &= 54
\end{align*}and finds that this system of equations has a single real number solution $x > 1$. Find $b$.
