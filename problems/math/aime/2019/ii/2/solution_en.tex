To get from $1$ to $7$, we need some jumps that sum to exactly $6$. The possible ways we can do this are $1+1+1+1+1+1$, $1+1+1+1+2$, $1+1+2+2$, $2+2+2$, and any permutations. The probability of each type is $\frac{1}{2^6}$, $\frac{5}{2^5}$, $\frac{6}{2^4}$, and $\frac{1}{2^3}$, respectively, so the probability is \[\frac{1}{64}+\frac{5}{32}+\frac{6}{16}+\frac{1}{8}=\frac{43}{64}\] giving the answer of $\boxed{107}$ as desired.
