There is a unique angle $\theta$ between $0^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ such that for nonnegative integers $n$, the value of $\tan{\left(2^{n}\theta\right)}$ is positive when $n$ is a multiple of $3$, and negative otherwise. The degree measure of $\theta$ is $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime integers. Find $p+q$.
