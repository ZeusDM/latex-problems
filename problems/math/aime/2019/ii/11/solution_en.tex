Perform $\sqrt{bc}$ inversion so that $\omega_1$ becomes a line through $C$ parallel to $AB$ and $\omega_2$ becomes a line through $B$ parallel to $AC$. Then $K$ maps to the $A$-anticomplementary vertex so that \[AK=\frac{bc}{\sqrt{2\left(b^2+c^2\right)-a^2}}=\frac{7\cdot9}{\sqrt{2\left(7^2+9^2\right)-8^2}}=\frac{9}{2}\] giving the answer of $\boxed{011}$ as desired.
