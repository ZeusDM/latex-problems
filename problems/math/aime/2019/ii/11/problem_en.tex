Triangle $ABC$ has side lengths $AB=7, BC=8, $ and $CA=9.$ Circle $\omega_1$ passes through $B$ and is tangent to line $AC$ at $A.$ Circle $\omega_2$ passes through $C$ and is tangent to line $AB$ at $A.$ Let $K$ be the intersection of circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ not equal to $A.$ Then $AK=\tfrac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
