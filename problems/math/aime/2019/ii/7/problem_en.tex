Triangle $ABC$ has side lengths $AB=120$, $BC=220$, and $AC=180$. Lines $\ell_{A}$, $\ell_{B}$, and $\ell_{C}$ are drawn parallel to $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{AC}$, and $\overline{AB}$, respectively, such that the intersection of $\ell_{A}$, $\ell_{B}$, and $\ell_{C}$ with the interior or $\triangle ABC$ are segments of length $55$, $45$, and $15$, respectively. Find the perimeter of the triangle whose sides lie on $\ell_{A}$, $\ell_{B}$, and $\ell_{C}$.
