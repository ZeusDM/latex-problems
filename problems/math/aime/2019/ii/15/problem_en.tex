In acute triangle $ABC$ points $P$ and $Q$ are the feet of the perpendiculars from $C$ to $\overline{AB}$ and from $B$ to $\overline{AC}$, respectively.  Line $PQ$ intersects the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ in two distinct points, $X$ and $Y$.  Suppose $XP=10$, $PQ=25$, and $QY=15$.  The value of $AB\cdot AC$ can be written in the form $m\sqrt n$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.
