Two three-letter strings, $aaa$ and $bbb$, are transmitted electronically. Each string is sent letter by letter. Due to faulty equipment, each of the six letters has a 1/3 chance of being received incorrectly, as an $a$ when it should have been a $b$, or as a $b$ when it should be an $a$. However, whether a given letter is received correctly or incorrectly is independent of the reception of any other letter. Let $S_a$ be the three-letter string received when $aaa$ is transmitted and let $S_b$ be the three-letter string received when $bbb$ is transmitted. Let $p$ be the probability that $S_a$ comes before $S_b$ in alphabetical order. When $p$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is its numerator?
