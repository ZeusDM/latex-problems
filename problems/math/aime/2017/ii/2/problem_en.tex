Teams $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_3$, and $T_4$ are in the playoffs. In the semifinal matches, $T_1$ plays $T_4$ and $T_2$ plays $T_3$. The winners of those two matches will play each other in the final match to determine the champion. When $T_i$ plays $T_j$, the probability that $T_i$ wins is $\frac{i}{i+j}$, and the outcomes of all the matches are independent. The probability that $T_4$ will be the champion is $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.
