Consider arrangements of the $9$ numbers $1, 2, 3, \dots, 9$ in a $3 \times 3$ array. For each such arrangement, let $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ be the medians of the numbers in rows $1$, $2$, and $3$ respectively, and let $m$ be the median of $\{a_1, a_2, a_3\}$. Let $Q$ be the number of arrangements for which $m = 5$. Find the remainder when $Q$ is divided by $1000$.
