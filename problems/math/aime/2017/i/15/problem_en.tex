The area of the smallest equilateral triangle with one vertex on each of the sides of the right triangle with side lengths $2\sqrt3$,  $5$,  and $\sqrt{37}$,  as shown, is $\tfrac{m\sqrt{p}}{n}$,  where $m$,  $n$,  and $p$ are positive integers, $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, and $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n+p$.
