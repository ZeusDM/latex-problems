Let $z_1 = 18 + 83i$, $z_2 = 18 + 39i, $ and $z_3 = 78 + 99i,$ where $i = \sqrt{-1}$. Let $z$ be the unique complex number with the properties that $\frac{z_3 - z_1}{z_2 - z_1} \cdot \frac{z - z_2}{z - z_3}$ is a real number and the imaginary part of $z$ is the greatest possible. Find the real part of $z$.
