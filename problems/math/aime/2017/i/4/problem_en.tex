A pyramid has a triangular base with side lengths $20$,  $20$,  and $24$. The three edges of the pyramid from the three corners of the base to the fourth vertex of the pyramid all have length $25$. The volume of the pyramid is $m\sqrt{n}$,  where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $m+n$.
