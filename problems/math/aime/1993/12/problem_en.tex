The vertices of $\triangle ABC$ are $A = (0,0)$, $B = (0,420)$, and $C = (560,0)$.  The six faces of a die are labeled with two $A$'s, two $B$'s, and two $C$'s.  Point $P_1 = (k,m)$ is chosen in the interior of $\triangle ABC$, and points $P_2$, $P_3$, $P_4, \dots$ are generated by rolling the die repeatedly and applying the rule: If the die shows label $L$, where $L \in \{A, B, C\}$, and $P_n$ is the most recently obtained point, then $P_{n + 1}$ is the midpoint of $\overline{P_n L}$.  Given that $P_7 = (14,92)$, what is $k + m$?
