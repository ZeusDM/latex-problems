The table below displays some of the results of last summer's Frostbite Falls Fishing Festival, showing how many contestants caught $n$ fish for various values of $n$.

\[ \begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline n & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & \dots & 13 & 14 & 15 \\ \hline \text{number of contestants who caught} \ n \ \text{fish} & 9 & 5 & 7 & 23 & \dots & 5 & 2 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}  \]

In the newspaper story covering the event, it was reported that
(a) the winner caught 15 fish;
(b) those who caught 3 or more fish averaged 6 fish each;
(c) those who caught 12 or fewer fish averaged 5 fish each.

What was the total number of fish caught during the festival?
