Three numbers, $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, are drawn randomly and without replacement from the set $\{1, 2, 3, \dots, 1000\}$.  Three other numbers, $b_1$, $b_2$, $b_3$, are then drawn randomly and without replacement from the remaining set of 997 numbers.  Let $p$ be the probability that, after a suitable rotation, a brick of dimensions $a_1 \times a_2 \times a_3$ can be enclosed in a box of dimensions $b_1 \times b_2 \times b_3$, with the sides of the brick parallel to the sides of the box.  If $p$ is written as a fraction in lowest terms, what is the sum of the numerator and denominator?
