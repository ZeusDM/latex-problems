Let $S$ be a set with six elements.  In how many different ways can one select two not necessarily distinct subsets of $S$ so that the union of the two subsets is $S$?  The order of selection does not matter; for example, the pair of subsets $\{a, c\}$, $\{b, c, d, e, f\}$ represents the same selection as the pair $\{b, c, d, e, f\}$, $\{a, c\}$.
