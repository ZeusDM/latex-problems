A rectangle that is inscribed in a larger rectangle (with one vertex on each side) is called \textit{unstuck} if it is possible to rotate (however slightly) the smaller rectangle about its center within the confines of the larger. Of all the rectangles that can be inscribed unstuck in a 6 by 8 rectangle, the smallest perimeter has the form $\sqrt{N}$, for a positive integer $N$. Find $N$.
