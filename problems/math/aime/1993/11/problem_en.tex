Alfred and Bonnie play a game in which they take turns tossing a fair coin.  The winner of a game is the first person to obtain a head.  Alfred and Bonnie play this game several times with the stipulation that the loser of a game goes first in the next game.  Suppose that Alfred goes first in the first game, and that the probability that he wins the sixth game is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  What are the last three digits of $m + n$?
