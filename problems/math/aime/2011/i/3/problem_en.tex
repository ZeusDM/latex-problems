Let $L$ be the line with slope $\tfrac{5}{12}$ that contains the point $A=(24,-1)$, and let $M$ be the line perpendicular to line $L$ that contains the point $B=(5,6)$. The original coordinate axes are erased, and line $L$ is made the $x$-axis, and line $M$ the $y$-axis. In the new coordinate system, point $A$ is on the positive $x$-axis, and point $B$ is on the positive $y$-axis. The point $P$ with coordinates $(-14,27)$ in the original system has coordinates $(\alpha,\beta)$ in the new coordinate system. Find $\alpha+\beta$.
