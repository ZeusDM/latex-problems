Jar A contains four liters of a solution that is $45\%$ acid. Jar B contains five liters of a solution that is $48\%$ acid. Jar C contains one liter of a solution that is $k\%$ acid. From jar C, $\tfrac{m}{n}$ liters of the solution is added to jar A, and the remainder of the solution in jar C is added to jar B. At the end, both jar A and jar B contain solutions that are $50\%$ acid. Given that $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $k+m+n$.
