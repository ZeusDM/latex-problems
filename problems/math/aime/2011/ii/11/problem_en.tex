Let $M_n$ be the $n\times n$ matrix with entries as follows: for $1\leq i \leq n$, $m_{i,i}=10$; for $1\leq i \leq n-1, m_{i+1,i}=m_{i,i+1}=3$; all other entries in $M_n$ are zero. Let $D_n$ be the determinant of matrix $M_n$. Then $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \dfrac{1}{8D_n+1}$ can be represented as $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.

Note: The determinant of the $1\times 1$ matrix $[a]$ is $a$, and the determinant of the $2\times 2$ matrix $\left[ \begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c & d \end{array} \right]=ad-bc$; for $n\geq 2$, the determinant of an $n\times n$ matrix with first row or first column $a_1\ a_2\ a_3 \dots\ a_n$ is equal to $a_1C_1 - a_2C_2 + a_3C_3 - \dots + (-1)^{n+1} a_nC_n$, where $C_i$ is the determinant of the $(n-1)\times (n-1)$ matrix found by eliminating the row and column containing $a_i$.
