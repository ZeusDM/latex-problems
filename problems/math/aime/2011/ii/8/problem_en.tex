Let $z_1,z_2,z_3,\dots,z_{12}$ be the 12 zeroes of the polynomial $z^{12}-2^{36}$. For each $j$, let $w_j$ be one of $z_j$ or $i z_j$. Then the maximum possible value of the real part of $\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{12} w_j$ can be written as $m+\sqrt{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers. Find $m+n$.
