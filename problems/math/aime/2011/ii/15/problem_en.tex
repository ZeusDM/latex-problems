Let $P(x)=x^2-3x-9$. A real number $x$ is chosen at random from the interval $5\leq x \leq 15$. The probability that $\lfloor \sqrt{P(x)} \rfloor = \sqrt{P(\lfloor x \rfloor )}$ is equal to $\dfrac{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}+\sqrt{c}-d}{e}$, where $a,b,c,d$ and $e$ are positive integers and none of $a,b,$ or $c$ is divisible by the square of a prime. Find $a+b+c+d+e$.
