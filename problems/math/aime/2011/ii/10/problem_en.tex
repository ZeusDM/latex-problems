A circle with center $O$ has radius 25. Chord $\overline{AB}$ of length 30 and chord $\overline{CD}$ of length 14 intersect at point $P$. The distance between the midpoints of the two chords is 12. The quantity $OP^2$ can be represented as $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder where $m+n$ is divided by 1000.
