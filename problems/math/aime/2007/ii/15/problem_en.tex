Four circles $\omega,$ $\omega_{A},$ $\omega_{B},$ and $\omega_{C}$ with the same radius are drawn in the interior of triangle $ABC$ such that $\omega_{A}$ is tangent to sides $AB$ and $AC$, $\omega_{B}$ to $BC$ and $BA$, $\omega_{C}$ to $CA$ and $CB$, and $\omega$ is externally tangent to $\omega_{A},$ $\omega_{B},$ and $\omega_{C}$. If the sides of triangle $ABC$ are $13,$ $14,$ and $15,$ the radius of $\omega$ can be represented in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$
