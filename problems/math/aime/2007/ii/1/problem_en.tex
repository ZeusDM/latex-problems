A mathematical organization is producing a set of commemorative license plates. Each plate contains a sequence of five characters chosen from the four letters in AIME and the four digits in $2007$. No character may appear in a sequence more times than it appears among the four letters in AIME or the four digits in $2007$. A set of plates in which each possible sequence appears exactly once contains $N$ license plates. Find $\frac{N}{10}$.
