In isosceles triangle $ABC$, $A$ is located at the origin and $B$ is located at $(20, 0)$.  Point $C$ is in the first quadrant with $AC = BC$ and $\angle BAC = 75^\circ$.  If $\triangle ABC$ is rotated counterclockwise about point $A$ until the image of $C$ lies on the positive y-axis, the area of the region common to the original and the rotated triangle is in the form $p\sqrt{2}+q\sqrt{3}+r\sqrt{6}+s$ where $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$ are integers.  Find $(p-q+r-s)/2$.
