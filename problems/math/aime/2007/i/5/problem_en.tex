The formula for converting a Fahrenheit temperature $F$ to the corresponding Celsius temperature $C$ is $C=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$.  An integer Fahrenheit temperature is converted to Celsius and rounded to the nearest integer; the resulting integer Celsius temperature is converted back to Fahrenheit and rounded to the nearest integer.  For how many integer Fahrenheit temperatures $T$ with $32 \leq T \leq 1000$ does the original temperature equal the final temperature?
