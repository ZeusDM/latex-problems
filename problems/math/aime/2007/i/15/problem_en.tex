Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle, and let $D$ and $F$ be points on sides $BC$ and $AB$, respectively, with $FA=5$ and $CD=2$.  Point $E$ lies on side $CA$ such that $\angle DEF = 60^\circ$.  The area of triangle $DEF$ is $14\sqrt{3}$.  The two possible values of the length of side $AB$ are $p \pm q\sqrt{r}$, where $p$ and $q$ are rational, and $r$ is an integer not divisible by the square of a prime.  Find $r$.
