A frog is placed at the origin on a number line, and moves according to the following rule: in a given move, the frog advanced to either the closest integer point with a greater integer coordinate that is a multiple of 3, or to the closest integer point with a greater integer coordinate that is a multiple of 13.  A \textit{move sequence} is a sequence of coordinates which correspond to valid moves, beginning with 0, and ending with 39.  For example, 0, 3, 6, 13, 15, 26, 39 is a move sequence.  How many move sequences are possible for the frog?
