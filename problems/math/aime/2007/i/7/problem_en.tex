Let \[N= \sum_{k=1}^{1000}k(\lceil \log_{\sqrt{2}}k\rceil-\lfloor \log_{\sqrt{2}}k \rfloor).\] Find the remainder when N is divided by 1000.  (Here $\lfloor x \rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer that is less than or equal to x, and $\lceil x \rceil$ denotes the least integer that is greater than or equal to x.)
