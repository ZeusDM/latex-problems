Lily pads $1,2,3,\ldots$ lie in a row on a pond.  A frog makes a sequence of jumps starting on pad $1$.  From any pad $k$ the frog jumps to either pad $k+1$ or pad $k+2$ chosen randomly and independently with probability $\tfrac12$.  The probability that the frog visits pad $7$ is $\tfrac pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $p+q$.
