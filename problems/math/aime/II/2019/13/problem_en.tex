Regular octagon $A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5A_6A_7A_8$ is inscribed in a circle of area $1$.  Point $P$ lies inside the circle so that the region bounded by $\overline{PA_1}$, $\overline{PA_2}$, and the minor arc $\widehat{A_1A_2}$ of the circle has area $\tfrac17$, while the region bounded by $\overline{PA_3}$, $\overline{PA_4}$, and the minor arc $\widehat{A_3A_4}$ of the circle has area $\tfrac 19$.  There is a positive integer $n$ such that the area of the region bounded by $\overline{PA_6}$, $\overline{PA_7}$, and the minor arc $\widehat{A_6A_7}$ is equal to $\tfrac18 - \tfrac{\sqrt 2}n$.  Find $n$.
