Let $S$ be the set of all rational numbers $r$, $0<r<1$, that have a repeating decimal expansion in the form \[0.abcabcabc\ldots=0.\overline{abc},\]where the digits $a$, $b$, and $c$ are not necessarily distinct. To write the elements of $S$ as fractions in lowest terms, how many different numerators are required?
