A circle with diameter $\overline{PQ}$ of length 10 is internally tangent at $P$ to a circle of radius 20. Square $ABCD$ is constructed with $A$ and $B$ on the larger circle, $\overline{CD}$ tangent at $Q$ to the smaller circle, and the smaller circle outside $ABCD$. The length of $\overline{AB}$ can be written in the form $m + \sqrt{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers. Find $m + n$.
