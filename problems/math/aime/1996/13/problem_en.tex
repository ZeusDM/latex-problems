In triangle $ABC, AB=\sqrt{30}, AC=\sqrt{6},$ and $BC=\sqrt{15}.$  There is a point $D$ for which $\overline{AD}$ bisects $\overline{BC}$ and $\angle ADB$ is a right angle.  The ratio \[ \frac{\text{Area}(\triangle ADB)}{\text{Area}(\triangle ABC)} \] can be written in the form $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m+n.$
