Let $w$ and $z$ be complex numbers such that $|w| = 1$ and $|z| = 10$. Let $\theta = \arg\left(\tfrac{w-z}{z}\right)$. The maximum possible value of $\tan^2 \theta$ can be written as $\tfrac{p}{q}$,  where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$. (Note that $\arg(w)$,  for $w \neq 0$,  denotes the measure of the angle that the ray from $0$ to $w$ makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane.
