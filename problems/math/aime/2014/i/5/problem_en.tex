Let the set $S = \{P_1, P_2, \cdots, P_{12}\}$ consist of the twelve vertices of a regular $12$-gon. A subset $Q$ of $S$ is called communal if there is a circle such that all points of $Q$ are inside the circle, and all points of $S$ not in $Q$ are outside of the circle. How many communal subsets are there? (Note that the empty set is a communal subset.)
