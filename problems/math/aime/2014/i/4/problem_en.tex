Jon and Steve ride their bicycles

 on a path that parallels two side-by-side train tracks running in the 

east/west direction. Jon rides east at 20 miles per hour, and Steve 

rides west at 20 miles per hour. Two trains of equal length traveling in

 opposite directions at constant but different speeds, each pass the two

 riders. Each train takes exactly 1 minute to go past Jon. The westbound

 train takes 10 times as long as the eastbound train to go past Steve. 

The length of each train is $\tfrac mn$,  where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
