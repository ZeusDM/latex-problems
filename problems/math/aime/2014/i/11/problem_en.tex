A token starts at the point $(0,0)$ of an $xy$-coordinate grid and them makes a sequence of six moves. Each move is $1$

 unit in a direction parallel to one of the coordinate axes. Each move 

is selected randomly from the four possible directions and independently

 of the other moves. The probability the token ends at a point on the 

graph of $|y|=|x|$ is $\tfrac{m}{n}$,  where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
