In $ \triangle ABC $,  $ AB = 3 $,  $ BC = 4 $,  and $ CA = 5 $. Circle $\omega$ intersects $\overline{AB}$ at $E$ and $B$,  $\overline{BC}$ at $B$ and $D$,  and $\overline{AC}$ at $F$ and $G$. Given that $EF=DF$ and $\tfrac{DG}{EG} = \tfrac{3}{4}$,  length $DE=\tfrac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}$,  where $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime positive integers, and $b$ is a positive integer not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c$.
