Let $z$ be a complex number with $|z| = 2014$. Let $P$ be the polygon in the complex plane whose vertices are $z$ and every $w$ such that $\tfrac{1}{z+w} = \tfrac{1}{z} + \tfrac{1}{w}$. Then the area enclosed by $P$ can be written in the form $n\sqrt{3},$ where $n$ is an integer. Find the remainder when $n$ is divided by $1000$.
