In $\triangle RED, RD =1, \angle DRE = 75^\circ$ and $\angle RED = 45^\circ$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of segment $\overline{RD}$. Point $C$ lies on side $\overline{ED}$ such that $\overline{RC} \perp \overline{EM}$. Extend segment $\overline{DE}$ through $E$ to point $A$ such that $CA = AR$. Then $AE = \tfrac{a-\sqrt{b}}{c},$ where $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime positive integers, and $b$ is a positive integer. Find $a+b+c$.
