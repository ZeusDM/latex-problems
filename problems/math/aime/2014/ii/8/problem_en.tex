Circle $C$ with radius $2$ has diameter $\overline{AB}$. Circle $D$ is internally tangent to circle $C$ at $A$. Circle $E$ is internally tangent to circle $C,$ externally tangent to circle $D,$ and tangent to $\overline{AB}$. The radius of circle $D$ is three times the radius of circle $E$ and can be written in the form $\sqrt{m} - n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers. Find $m+n$.
