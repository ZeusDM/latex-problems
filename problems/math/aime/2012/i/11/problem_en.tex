A frog begins at $P_0 = (0,0)$ and makes a sequence of jumps according to the following rule: from $P_n=(x_n,y_n)$, the frog jumps to $P_{n+1}$, which may be  any of the points $(x_n+7, y_n+2)$, $(x_n+2,y_n+7)$, $(x_n-5, y_n-10)$, or $(x_n-10,y_n-5)$.  There are $M$ points $(x,y)$ with $|x|+|y| \le 100$ that can be reached by a sequence of such jumps.  Find the remainder when $M$ is divided by $1000$.
