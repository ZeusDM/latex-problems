Three concentric circles have radii $3$, $4$, and $5$.  An equilateral triangle with one vertex on each circle has side length $s$.  The largest possible area of the triangle can be written as $a+\frac{b}{c}\sqrt{d}$, where $a,b,c$ and $d$ are positive integers, $b$ and $c$ are relatively prime, and $d$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $a+b+c+d$.
