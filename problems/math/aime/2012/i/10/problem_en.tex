Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all perfect squares whose rightmost three digits in base $10$ are $256$. Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the set of all numbers of the form $\frac{x-256}{1000}$, where $x$ is in $\mathcal{S}$. In other words, $\mathcal{T}$ is the set of numbers that result when the last three digits of each number in $\mathcal{S}$ are truncated. Find the remainder when the tenth smallest element of $\mathcal{T}$ is divided by $1000$.
