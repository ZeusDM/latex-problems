Triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in circle $\omega$ with $AB = 5$, $BC = 7$, and $AC = 3$. The bisector of angle $A$ meets side $BC$ at $D$ and circle $\omega$ at a second point $E$. Let $\gamma$ be the circle with diameter $DE$. Circles $\omega$ and $\gamma$ meet at $E$ and a second point $F$. Then $AF^2 = \frac mn$, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.
