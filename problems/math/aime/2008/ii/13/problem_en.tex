A regular hexagon with center at the origin in the complex plane has opposite pairs of sides one unit apart. One pair of sides is parallel to the imaginary axis. Let $ R$ be the region outside the hexagon, and let $ S=\{\frac{1}{z}|z\in R\}$. Then the area of $ S$ has the form $ a\pi+\sqrt{b}$, where $ a$ and $ b$ are positive integers. Find $ a+b$.
