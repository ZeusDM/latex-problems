In triangle $ ABC$, $ AB = AC = 100$, and $ BC = 56$. Circle $ P$ has radius $ 16$ and is tangent to $ \overline{AC}$ and $ \overline{BC}$. Circle $ Q$ is externally tangent to $ P$ and is tangent to $ \overline{AB}$ and $ \overline{BC}$. No point of circle $ Q$ lies outside of $ \triangle ABC$. The radius of circle $ Q$ can be expressed in the form $ m - n\sqrt {k}$, where $ m$, $ n$, and $ k$ are positive integers and $ k$ is the product of distinct primes. Find $ m + nk$.
