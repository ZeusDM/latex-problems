Let $ ABCD$ be an isosceles trapezoid with $ \overline{AD}||\overline{BC}$ whose angle at the longer base $ \overline{AD}$ is $ \dfrac{\pi}{3}$. The diagonals have length $ 10\sqrt {21}$, and point $ E$ is at distances $ 10\sqrt {7}$ and $ 30\sqrt {7}$ from vertices $ A$ and $ D$, respectively. Let $ F$ be the foot of the altitude from $ C$ to $ \overline{AD}$. The distance $ EF$ can be expressed in the form $ m\sqrt {n}$, where $ m$ and $ n$ are positive integers and $ n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $ m + n$.
