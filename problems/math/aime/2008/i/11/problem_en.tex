Consider sequences that consist entirely of $ A$'s and $ B$'s and that have the property that every run of consecutive $ A$'s has even length, and every run of consecutive $ B$'s has odd length. Examples of such sequences are $ AA$, $ B$, and $ AABAA$, while $ BBAB$ is not such a sequence. How many such sequences have length 14?
