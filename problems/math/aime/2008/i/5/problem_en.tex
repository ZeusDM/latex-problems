A right circular cone has base radius $ r$ and height $ h$.  The cone lies on its side on a flat table.  As the cone rolls on the surface of the table without slipping, the point where the cone's base meets the table traces a circular arc centered  at the point where the vertex touches the table.  The cone first returns to its original position on the table after making $ 17$ complete rotations.  The value of $ h/r$ can be written in the form $ m\sqrt {n}$, where $ m$ and $ n$ are positive integers and $ n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $ m + n$.
