Ed and Sue bike at equal and constant rates.  Similarly, they jog at equal and constant rates, and they swim at equal and constant rates.  Ed covers $ 74$ kilometers after biking for $ 2$ hours, jogging for $ 3$ hours, and swimming for $ 4$ hours, while Sue covers $ 91$ kilometers after jogging for $ 2$ hours, swimming for $ 3$ hours, and biking for $ 4$ hours.  Their biking, jogging, and swimming rates are all whole numbers of kilometers per hour.  Find the sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates.
