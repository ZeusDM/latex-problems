A solid in the shape of a right circular cone is 4 inches tall and its base has a 3-inch radius. The entire surface of the cone, including its base, is painted. A plane parallel to the base of the cone divides the cone into two solids, a smaller cone-shaped solid $C$ and a frustum-shaped solid $F$, in such a way that the ratio between the areas of the painted surfaces of $C$ and $F$ and the ratio between the volumes of $C$ and $F$ are both equal to $k$. Given that $k=m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.
