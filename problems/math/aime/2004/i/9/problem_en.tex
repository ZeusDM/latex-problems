Let $ABC$ be a triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5, and $DEFG$ be a 6-by-7 rectangle. A segment is drawn to divide triangle $ABC$ into a triangle $U_1$ and a trapezoid $V_1$ and another segment is drawn to divide rectangle $DEFG$ into a triangle $U_2$ and a trapezoid $V_2$ such that $U_1$ is similar to $U_2$ and $V_1$ is similar to $V_2$. The minimum value of the area of $U_1$ can be written in the form $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
