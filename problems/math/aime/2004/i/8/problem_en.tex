Define a regular $n$-pointed star to be the union of $n$ line segments $P_1P_2, P_2P_3,\ldots, P_nP_1$ such that

$\bullet$ the points $P_1, P_2,\ldots, P_n$ are coplanar and no three of them are collinear,
$\bullet$ each of the $n$ line segments intersects at least one of the other line segments at a point other than an endpoint,
$\bullet$ all of the angles at $P_1, P_2,\ldots, P_n$ are congruent,
$\bullet$ all of the $n$ line segments $P_2P_3,\ldots, P_nP_1$ are congruent, and
$\bullet$ the path $P_1P_2, P_2P_3,\ldots, P_nP_1$ turns counterclockwise at an angle of less than 180 degrees at each vertex.

There are no regular 3-pointed, 4-pointed, or 6-pointed stars. All regular 5-pointed stars are similar, but there are two non-similar regular 7-pointed stars. How many non-similar regular 1000-pointed stars are there?
