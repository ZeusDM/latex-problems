Let $S$ be the set of ordered pairs $(x, y)$ such that $0<x\le 1$, $0<y\le 1$, and $\left[\log_2{\left(\frac 1x\right)}\right]$ and $\left[\log_5{\left(\frac 1y\right)}\right]$ are both even. Given that the area of the graph of $S$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$. The notation $[z]$ denotes the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $z$.
