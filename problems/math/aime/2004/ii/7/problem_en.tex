$ABCD$ is a rectangular sheet of paper that has been folded so that corner $B$ is matched with point $B'$ on edge $AD$. The crease is $EF$, where $E$ is on $AB$ and $F$is on $CD$. The dimensions $AE=8$, $BE=17$, and $CF=3$ are given. The perimeter of rectangle $ABCD$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.
