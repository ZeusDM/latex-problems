Let $ABCD$ be an isosceles trapezoid, whose dimensions are $AB = 6$, $BC=5=DA$, and $CD=4$. Draw circles of radius 3 centered at $A$ and $B$, and circles of radius 2 centered at $C$ and $D$. A circle contained within the trapezoid is tangent to all four of these circles. Its radius is $\frac{-k+m\sqrt{n}}p$, where $k$, $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers, $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, and $k$ and $p$ are relatively prime. Find $k+m+n+p$.
