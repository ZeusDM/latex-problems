Let $ABCDE$ be a convex pentagon with $AB\parallel CE$, $BC\parallel AD$, $AC\parallel DE$, $\angle ABC=120^\circ$, $AB=3$, $BC=5$, and $DE=15$. Given that the ratio between the area of triangle $ABC$ and the area of triangle $EBD$ is $m/n$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.
