Consider a string of $n$ 7's, $7777\cdots77$, into which $+$ signs are inserted to produce an arithmetic expression. For example, $7+77+777+7+7=875$ could be obtained from eight 7's in this way. For how many values of $n$ is it possible to insert $+$ signs so that the resulting expression has value 7000?
