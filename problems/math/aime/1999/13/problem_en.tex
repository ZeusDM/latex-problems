Forty teams play a tournament in which every team plays every other team exactly once.  No ties occur, and each team has a $50 \%$ chance of winning any game it plays.  The probability that no two teams win the same number of games is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $\log_2 n.$
