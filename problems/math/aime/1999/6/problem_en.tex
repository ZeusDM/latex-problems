A transformation of the first quadrant of the coordinate plane maps each point $(x,y)$ to the point $(\sqrt{x},\sqrt{y}).$  The vertices of quadrilateral $ABCD$ are $A=(900,300), B=(1800,600), C=(600,1800),$ and $D=(300,900).$  Let $k$ be the area of the region enclosed by the image of quadrilateral $ABCD.$  Find the greatest integer that does not exceed $k.$
