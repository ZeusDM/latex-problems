A function $f$ is defined on the complex numbers by $f(z)=(a+bi)z,$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive numbers.  This function has the property that the image of each point in the complex plane is equidistant from that point and the origin.  Given that $|a+bi|=8$ and that $b^2=m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Find $m+n.$
