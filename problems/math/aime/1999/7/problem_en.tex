There is a set of 1000 switches, each of which has four positions, called $A, B, C,$ and $D.$  When the position of any switch changes, it is only from $A$ to $B,$ from $B$ to $C,$ from $C$ to $D,$ or from $D$ to $A.$  Initially each switch is in position $A.$  The switches are labeled with the 1000 different integers $2^x3^y5^z,$ where $x, y,$ and $z$ take on the values $0, 1, \ldots, 9.$  At step $i$ of a 1000-step process, the $i$th switch is advanced one step, and so are all the other switches whose labels divide the label on the $i$th switch.  After step 1000 has been completed, how many switches will be in position $A$?
