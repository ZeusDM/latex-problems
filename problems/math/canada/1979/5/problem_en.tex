A walk consists of a sequence of steps of length 1 taken in the directions north, south, east, or west.  A walk is self-avoiding if it never passes through the same point twice.  Let $f(n)$ be the number of $n$-step self-avoiding walks which begin at the origin.  Compute $f(1)$,  $f(2)$,  $f(3)$,  $f(4)$,  and show that\[2^n < f(n) \le 4 \cdot 3^{n - 1}.\]
