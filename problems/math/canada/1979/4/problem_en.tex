A dog standing at the centre of a circular arena sees a rabbit at the wall.  The rabbit runs round the wall and the dog pursues it along a unique path which is determined by running at the same speed and staying on the radial line joining the centre of the arena to the rabbit.  Show that the dog overtakes the rabbit just as it reaches a point one-quarter of the way around the arena.
