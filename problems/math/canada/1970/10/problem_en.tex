Given the polynomial \[ f(x)=x^n+a_{1}x^{n-1}+a_{2}x^{n-2}+\cdots+a_{n-1}x+a_n \] with integer coefficients $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$,  and given also that there exist four distinct integers $a$,  $b$,  $c$ and $d$ such that \[ f(a)=f(b)=f(c)=f(d)=5, \] show that there is no integer $k$ such that $f(k)=8$.
