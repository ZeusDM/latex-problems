A 2-player game is played on $n\geq 3$ points, where no 3 points are collinear. Each move consists of selecting 2 of the points and drawing a new line segment connecting them. The first player to draw a line segment that creates an odd cycle loses. (An odd cycle must have all its vertices among the $n$ points from the start, so the vertices of the cycle cannot be the intersections of the lines drawn.) Find all $n$ such that the player to move first wins.
