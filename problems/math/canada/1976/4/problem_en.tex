Let $ AB$ be a diameter of a circle, $ C$ be any fixed point between $ A$ and $ B$ on this diameter, and $ Q$ be a variable point on the circumference of the circle. Let $ P$ be the point on the line determined by $ Q$ and $ C$ for which $ \frac{AC}{CB}=\frac{QC}{CP}$. Describe, with proof, the locus of the point $ P$.
