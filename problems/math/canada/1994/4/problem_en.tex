Let $AB$ be a diameter of a circle $\Omega$ and $P$ be any point not on the line through $AB$. Suppose that the line through $PA$ cuts $\Omega$ again at $U$,  and the line through $PB$ cuts $\Omega$ at $V$. Note that in case of tangency, $U$ may coincide with $A$ or $V$ might coincide with $B$. Also, if $P$ is on $\Omega$ then $P=U=V$. Suppose that $|PU|=s|PA|$ and $|PV|=t|PB|$ for some $0\le s,t\in \mathbb{R}$. Determine $\cos \angle APB$ in terms of $s,t$.
