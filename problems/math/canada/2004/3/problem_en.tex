Let $ A,B,C,D$ be four points on a circle (occurring in clockwise order), with $ AB<AD$ and $ BC>CD$. The bisectors of angles $ BAD$ and $ BCD$ meet the circle at $ X$ and $ Y$,  respectively. Consider the hexagon formed by these six points on the circle. If four of the six sides of the hexagon have equal length, prove that $ BD$ must be a diameter of the circle.
