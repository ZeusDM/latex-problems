Each vertex of a finite graph can be coloured either black or white. Initially all vertices are black. We are allowed to pick a vertex $P$ and change the colour of $P$ and all of its neighbours. Is it possible to change the colour of every vertex from black to white by a

sequence of operations of this type?

Note: A finite graph consists of a finite set of vertices and a finite set of edges between vertices. If there is an edge between vertex $A$ and vertex $B,$ then $A$ and $B$ are neighbours of each other.
