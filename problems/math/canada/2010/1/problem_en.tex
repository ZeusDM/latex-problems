For all natural $n$,  an $n$-staircase is a figure consisting of unit squares, with one square in the first row, two squares in the second row, and so on, up to $n$ squares in the $n^{th}$ row, such that all the left-most squares in each row are aligned vertically.

Let $f(n)$ denote the minimum number of square tiles requires to tile the $n$-staircase, where the side lengths of the square tiles can be any natural number. e.g. $f(2)=3$ and $f(4)=7$.

(a) Find all $n$ such that $f(n)=n$.

(b) Find all $n$ such that $f(n) = n+1$.
