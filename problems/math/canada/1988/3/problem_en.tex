Suppose that $S$ is a finite set of at least five points in the plane; some are coloured red, the others are coloured blue.  No subset of three or more similarly coloured points is collinear.  Show that there is a triangle

(i) whose vertices are all the same colour, and

(ii) at least one side of the triangle does not contain a point of the opposite colour.
