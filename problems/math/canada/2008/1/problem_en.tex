$ ABCD$ is a convex quadrilateral for which $ AB$ is the longest side. Points $ M$ and $ N$ are located on sides $ AB$ and $ BC$ respectively, so that each of the segments $ AN$ and $ CM$ divides the quadrilateral into two parts of equal area. Prove that the segment $ MN$ bisects the diagonal $ BD$.
