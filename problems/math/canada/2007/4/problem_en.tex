For two real numbers $ a$,  $ b$,  with $ ab\neq 1$,  define the $ \ast$ operation by\[ a\ast b=\frac{a+b-2ab}{1-ab}.\] Start with a list of $ n\geq 2$ real numbers whose entries $ x$ all satisfy $ 0<x<1$. Select any two numbers $ a$ and $ b$ in the list; remove them and put the number $ a\ast b$ at the end of the list, thereby reducing its length by one. Repeat this procedure until a single number remains.$ a.$ Prove that this single number is the same regardless of the choice of pair at each stage.$ b.$ Suppose that the condition on the numbers $ x$ is weakened to $ 0<x\leq 1$. What happens if the list contains exactly one $ 1$?
