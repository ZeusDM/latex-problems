Let $O$ denote the circumcentre of an acute-angled triangle $ABC$. Let point $P$ on side $AB$ be such that $\angle BOP = \angle ABC$,  and let point $Q$ on side $AC$ be such that $\angle COQ = \angle ACB$. Prove that the reflection of $BC$ in the line $PQ$ is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle $APQ$.
