The integers $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2016$ are written on a board. You can choose any two numbers on the board and replace them with their average. For example, you can replace $1$ and $2$ with $1.5$,  or you can replace $1$ and $3$ with a second copy of $2$. After $2015$ replacements of this kind, the board will have only one number left on it.

(a) Prove that there is a sequence of replacements that will make the final number equal to $2$.

(b) Prove that there is a sequence of replacements that will make the final number equal to $1000$.
