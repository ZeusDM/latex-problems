Let $\triangle ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with altitudes $AD$ and $BE$ meeting at $H$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of segment $AB$,  and suppose that the circumcircles of $\triangle DEM$ and $\triangle ABH$ meet at points $P$ and $Q$ with $P$ on the same side of $CH$ as $A$. Prove that the lines $ED, PH,$ and $MQ$ all pass through a single point on the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$.
