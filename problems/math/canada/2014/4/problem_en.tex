The quadrilateral $ABCD$ is inscribed in a circle. The point $P$ lies in the interior of $ABCD$,  and $\angle P AB = \angle P BC = \angle P CD = \angle P DA$. The lines $AD$ and $BC$ meet at $Q$,  and the lines $AB$ and $CD$ meet at $R$. Prove that the lines $P Q$ and $P R$ form the same angle as the diagonals of $ABCD$.
