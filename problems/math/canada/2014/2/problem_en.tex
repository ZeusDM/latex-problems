Let $m$ and $n$ be odd positive integers. Each square of an $m$ by $n$ board is coloured red or blue. A row is said to be red-dominated if there are more red squares than blue squares in the row. A column is said to be blue-dominated if there are more blue squares than red squares in the column. Determine the maximum possible value of the number of red-dominated rows plus the number of blue-dominated columns. Express your answer in terms of $m$ and $n$.
