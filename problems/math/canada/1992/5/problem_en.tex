A deck of $ 2n+1$ cards consists of a joker and, for each number between 1 and $ n$ inclusive, two cards marked with that number. The $ 2n+1$ cards are placed in a row, with the joker in the middle. For each $ k$ with $ 1 \leq k \leq n,$ the two cards numbered $ k$ have exactly $ k-1$ cards between them. Determine all the values of $ n$ not exceeding 10 for which this arrangement is possible. For which values of $ n$ is it impossible?
