Let $ABC$ be the right-angled isosceles triangle whose equal sides have length 1. $P$ is a point on the hypotenuse, and the feet of the perpendiculars from $P$ to the other sides are $Q$ and $R$. Consider the areas of the triangles $APQ$ and $PBR$,  and the area of the rectangle $QCRP$. Prove that regardless of how $P$ is chosen, the largest of these three areas is at least $2/9$.
