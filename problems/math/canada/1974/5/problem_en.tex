Given a circle with diameter $AB$ and a point $X$ on the circle different from $A$ and $B$,  let $t_{a}$,  $t_{b}$ and $t_{x}$ be the tangents to the circle at $A$,  $B$ and $X$ respectively. Let $Z$ be the point where line $AX$ meets $t_{b}$ and $Y$ the point where line $BX$ meets $t_{a}$. Show that the three lines $YZ$,  $t_{x}$ and $AB$ are either concurrent (i.e., all pass through the same point) or parallel.Invalid URL
