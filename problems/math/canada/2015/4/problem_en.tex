Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with circumcenter $O$. Let $I$ be a circle with center on the altitude from $A$ in $ABC$,  passing through vertex $A$ and points $P$ and $Q$ on sides $AB$ and $AC$. Assume that\[BP\cdot CQ = AP\cdot AQ.\]Prove that $I$ is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle $BOC$.
