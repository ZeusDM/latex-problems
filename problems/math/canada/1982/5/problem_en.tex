The altitudes of a tetrahedron $ABCD$ are extended externally to points $A'$,  $B'$,  $C'$,  and $D'$,  where $AA' = k/h_a$,  $BB' = k/h_b$,  $CC' = k/h_c$,  and $DD' = k/h_d$.  Here, $k$ is a constant and $h_a$ denotes the length of the altitude of $ABCD$ from vertex $A$,  etc.  Prove that the centroid of tetrahedron $A'B'C'D'$ coincides with the centroid of $ABCD$.
