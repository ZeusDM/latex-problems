The closed interval $A = [0, 50]$ is the union of a finite number of closed intervals, each of length $1$. Prove that some of the intervals can be removed so that those remaining are mutually disjoint and have total length greater than $25$.

Note: For reals $a\le b$,  the closed interval $[a, b] := \{x\in \mathbb{R}:a\le x\le b\}$ has length $b-a$; disjoint intervals have empty intersection.
