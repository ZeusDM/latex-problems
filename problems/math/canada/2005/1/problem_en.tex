An equilateral triangle of side length $ n$ is divided into unit triangles. Let $ f(n)$ be the number of paths from the triangle in the top row to the middle triangle in the bottom row, such that adjacent triangles in a path share a common edge and the path never travels up (from a lower row to a higher row) or revisits a triangle. An example is shown on the picture for $ n = 5$. Determine the value of $ f(2005)$.
