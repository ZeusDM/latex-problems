Let's say that an ordered triple of positive integers $(a,b,c)$ is $n$-powerful if $a\le b\le c,\gcd (a,b,c)=1$ and $a^n+b^n+c^n$ is divisible by $a+b+c$. For example, $(1,2,2)$ is $5$-powerful.$a)$ Determine all ordered triples (if any) which are $n$-powerful for all $n\ge 1$.$b)$ Determine all ordered triples (if any) which are $2004$-powerful and $2005$-powerful, but not $2007$-powerful.
