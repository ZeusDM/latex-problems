Prove that when three circles share the same chord $AB$,  every line through $A$ different from $AB$ determines the same ratio $X Y : Y Z$,  where $X$ is an arbitrary point different from $B$ on the first circle while $Y$ and $Z$ are the points where AX intersects the other two circles (labeled so that $Y$ is between $X$ and $Z$).
