The vertices of a right triangle $ABC$ inscribed in a circle divide the circumference into three arcs. The right angle is at $A$,  so that the opposite arc $BC$ is a semicircle while arc $BC$ and arc $AC$ are supplementary. To each of three arcs, we draw a tangent such that its point of tangency is the mid point of that portion of the tangent intercepted by the extended lines $AB,AC$. More precisely, the point $D$ on arc $BC$ is the midpoint of the segment joining the points $D'$ and $D''$ where tangent at $D$ intersects the extended lines $AB,AC$. Similarly for $E$ on arc $AC$ and $F$ on arc $AB$. Prove that triangle $DEF$ is equilateral.
