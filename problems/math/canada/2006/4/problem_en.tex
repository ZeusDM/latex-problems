Consider a round-robin tournament with $2n+1$ teams, where each team plays each other team exactly one. We say that three teams $X,Y$ and $Z$,  form a cycle triplet  if $X$ beats $Y$,  $Y$ beats $Z$ and $Z$ beats $X$. There are no ties.

a)Determine the minimum number of cycle triplets possible.

b)Determine the maximum number of cycle triplets possible.
