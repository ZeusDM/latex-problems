Let $m$ be a positive integer. Define the sequence $a_0, a_1, a_2, \cdots$ by $a_0 = 0,\; a_1 = m,$ and $a_{n+1} = m^2a_n - a_{n-1}$ for $n = 1,2,3,\cdots$.

Prove that an ordered pair $(a,b)$ of non-negative integers, with $a \leq b$,  gives a solution to the equation\[ {\displaystyle \frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab + 1} = m^2} \]

if and only if $(a,b)$ is of the form $(a_n,a_{n+1})$ for some $n \geq 0$.
