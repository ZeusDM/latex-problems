There are 5 monkeys and 5 ladders and at the top of each ladder there is a banana. A number of ropes connect the ladders, each rope connects two ladders. No two ropes are attached to the same rung of the same ladder. Each monkey starts at the bottom of a different ladder. The monkeys climb up the ladders but each time they encounter a rope they climb along it to the other ladder at the end of the rope and then continue climbing upwards. Show that, no matter how many ropes there are, each monkey gets a banana.
