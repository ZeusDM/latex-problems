A competition involving $n\ge 2$ players was held over $k$ days. In each day, the players received scores of $1,2,3,\ldots , n$ points with no players receiving the same score. At the end of the $k$ days, it was found that each player had exactly $26$ points in total. Determine all pairs $(n,k)$ for which this is possible.
