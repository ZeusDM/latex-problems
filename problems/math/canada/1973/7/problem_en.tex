Observe that\[\frac{1}{1}= \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2};\quad \frac{1}{2}=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6};\quad \frac{1}{3}=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{12};\quad \frac{1}{4}= \frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{20}. \]

State a general law suggested by these examples, and prove it.

Prove that for any integer $n$ greater than 1 there exist positive integers $i$ and $j$ such that\[\frac{1}{n}= \frac{1}{i(i+1)}+\frac{1}{(i+1)(i+2)}+\frac{1}{(i+2)(i+3)}+\cdots+\frac{1}{j(j+1)}. \]Remark.It seems that this is a two-part problem.
