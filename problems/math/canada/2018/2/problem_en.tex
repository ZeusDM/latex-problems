Let five points on a circle be labelled $A, B, C, D$,  and $E$ in clockwise order. Assume $AE = DE$ and let $P$ be the intersection of $AC$ and $BD$. Let $Q$ be the point on the line through $A$ and $B$ such that $A$ is between $B$ and $Q$ and $AQ = DP$ Similarly, let $R$ be the point on the line through $C$ and $D$ such that $D$ is between $C$ and $R$ and $DR = AP$. Prove that $PE$ is perpendicular to $QR$.
