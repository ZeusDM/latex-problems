At 12:00 noon, Anne, Beth and Carmen begin running laps around a circular track of length $300$ meters, all starting from the same point on the track. Each jogger maintains a constant speed in one of the two possible directions for an indefinite period of time. Show that if Anne's speed is different from the other two speeds, then at some later time Anne will be at least $100$ meters from each of the other runners.  (Here, distance is measured along the  shorter of the two arcs separating two runners.)
