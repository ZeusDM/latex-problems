Given a finite collection of lines in a plane $P$,  show that it is possible to draw an arbitrarily large circle in $P$ which does not meet any of them.  On the other hand, show that it is possible to arrange a countable infinite sequence of lines (first line, second line, third line, etc.) in $P$ so that every circle in $P$ meets at least one of the lines.  (A point is not considered to be a circle.)
