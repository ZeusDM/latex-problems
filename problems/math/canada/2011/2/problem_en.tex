Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral with opposite sides not parallel. Let $X$ and $Y$ be the intersections of $AB,CD$ and $AD,BC$ respectively. Let the angle bisector of $\angle AXD$ intersect $AD,BC$ at $E,F$ respectively, and let the angle bisectors of $\angle AYB$ intersect $AB,CD$ at $G,H$ respectively. Prove that $EFGH$ is a parallelogram.
