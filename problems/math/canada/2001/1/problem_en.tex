Randy: "Hi Rachel, that's an interesting quadratic equation you have written down.  What are its roots?''Rachel: "The roots are two positive integers.  One of the roots is my age, and the other root is the age of my younger brother, Jimmy.''Randy: "That is very neat!  Let me see if I can figure out how old you and Jimmy are.  That shouldn't be too difficult since all of your coefficients are integers.  By the way, I notice that the sum of the three coefficients is a prime number.''Rachel: "Interesting.  Now figure out how old I am.''Randy: "Instead, I will guess your age and substitute it for $x$ in your quadratic equation $\dots$ darn, that gives me $-55$,  and not $0$.''Rachel: "Oh, leave me alone!''

(1) Prove that Jimmy is two years old.

(2) Determine Rachel's age.
