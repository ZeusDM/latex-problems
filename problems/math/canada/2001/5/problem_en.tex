Let $P_0$,  $P_1$,  $P_2$ be three points on the circumference of a circle with radius $1$,  where $P_1P_2 = t < 2$. For each $i \ge 3$,  define $P_i$ to be the centre of the circumcircle of $\triangle P_{i-1} P_{i-2} P_{i-3}$.

(1)  Prove that the points $P_1, P_5, P_9, P_{13},\cdots$ are collinear.

(2)  Let $x$ be the distance from $P_1$ to $P_{1001}$,  and let $y$ be the distance from $P_{1001}$ to $P_{2001}$. Determine all values of $t$ for which $\sqrt[500]{ \frac xy}$ is an integer.
