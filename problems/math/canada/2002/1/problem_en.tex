Let $S$ be a subset of $\{1, 2, \dots, 9\}$,  such that the sums formed by adding each unordered pair of distinct numbers from $S$ are all different.  For example, the subset $\{1, 2, 3, 5\}$ has this property, but $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ does not, since the pairs $\{1, 4\}$ and $\{2, 3\}$ have the same sum, namely 5.

What is the maximum number of elements that $S$ can contain?
