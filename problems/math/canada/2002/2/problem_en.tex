Call a positive integer $n$ practical if every positive integer less than or equal to $n$ can be written as the sum of distinct divisors of $n$.

For example, the divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Since\[ \centerline{1={\bf 1}, ~~ 2={\bf 2}, ~~ 3={\bf 3}, ~~ 4={\bf 1}+{\bf 3}, ~~ 5={\bf 2}+ {\bf 3}, ~~ 6={\bf 6},} \]

we see that 6 is practical.

Prove that the product of two practical numbers is also practical.
