Let $\Gamma$ be a circle with radius $r$.  Let $A$ and $B$ be distinct points on $\Gamma$ such that $AB < \sqrt{3}r$.  Let the circle with centre $B$ and radius $AB$ meet $\Gamma$ again at $C$.  Let $P$ be the point inside $\Gamma$ such that triangle $ABP$ is equilateral.  Finally, let the line $CP$ meet $\Gamma$ again at $Q$.

Prove that $PQ = r$.
