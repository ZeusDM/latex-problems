Let $ABC$ be a triangle and let $I$ and $O$ denote its incentre and circumcentre respectively. Let $\omega_A$ be the circle through $B$ and $C$ which is tangent to the incircle of the triangle $ABC$; the circles $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ are defined similarly. The circles $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ meet at a point $A'$ distinct from $A$; the points $B'$ and $C'$ are defined similarly. Prove that the lines $AA',BB'$ and $CC'$ are concurrent at a point on the line $IO$.
