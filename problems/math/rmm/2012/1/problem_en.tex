Given a finite number of boys and girls, a \emph{sociable set of boys} is a set of boys such that every girl knows at least one boy in that set; and a \emph{sociable set of girls} is a set of girls such that every boy knows at least one girl in that set. Prove that the number of sociable sets of boys and the number of sociable sets of girls have the same parity. (Acquaintance is assumed to be mutual.)
