Each positive integer is coloured red or blue. A function $f$ from the set of positive integers to itself has the following two properties:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item if $x\le y$, then $f(x)\le f(y)$; and
	\item if $x,y$ and $z$ are (not necessarily distinct) positive integers of the same colour and $x+y=z$, then $f(x)+f(y)=f(z)$.
\end{enumerate}

Prove that there exists a positive number $a$ such that $f(x)\le ax$ for all positive integers $x$.
