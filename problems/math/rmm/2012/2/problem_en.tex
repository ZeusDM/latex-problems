Given a non-isosceles triangle $ABC$, let $D,E$, and $F$ denote the midpoints of the sides $BC,CA$, and $AB$ respectively. The circle $BCF$ and the line $BE$ meet again at $P$, and the circle $ABE$ and the line $AD$ meet again at $Q$. Finally, the lines $DP$ and $FQ$ meet at $R$. Prove that the centroid $G$ of the triangle $ABC$ lies on the circle $PQR$.
