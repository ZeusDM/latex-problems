Given positive integers $m$ and $n \ge m$, determine the largest number of dominoes ($1\times2$ or $2 \times 1$ rectangles) that can be placed on a rectangular board with $m$ rows and $2n$ columns consisting of cells ($1 \times 1$ squares) so that:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item each domino covers exactly two adjacent cells of the board;
	\item no two dominoes overlap;
	\item no two form a $2 \times 2$ square; and
	\item the bottom row of the board is completely covered by $n$ dominoes.
\end{enumerate}
