A $\emph{cubic sequence}$ is a sequence of integers given by $a_n =n^3 + bn^2 + cn + d$, where $b, c$ and $d$ are integer constants and $n$ ranges over all integers, including negative integers.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Show that there exists a cubic sequence such that the only terms of the sequence which are squares of integers are $a_{2015}$ and $a_{2016}$.
	\item Determine the possible values of $a_{2015} \cdot a_{2016}$ for a cubic sequence
satisfying the condition in part (a).
\end{enumerate}
