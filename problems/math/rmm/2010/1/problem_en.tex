For a finite non empty set of primes $P$, let $m(P)$ denote the largest possible number of consecutive positive integers, each of which is divisible by at least one member of $P$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item Show that $|P|\le m(P)$, with equality if and only if $\min(P)>|P|$.
	\item Show that $m(P)<(|P|+1)(2^{|P|}-1)$.
\end{enumerate}
(The number $|P|$ is the size of set $P$)
