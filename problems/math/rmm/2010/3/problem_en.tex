Let $A_1A_2A_3A_4$ be a quadrilateral with no pair of parallel sides. For each $i=1, 2, 3, 4$, define $\omega_1$ to be the circle touching the quadrilateral externally, and which is tangent to the lines $A_{i-1}A_i, A_iA_{i+1}$ and $A_{i+1}A_{i+2}$ (indices are considered modulo $4$ so $A_0=A_4, A_5=A_1$ and $A_6=A_2$). Let $T_i$ be the point of tangency of $\omega_i$ with the side $A_iA_{i+1}$. Prove that the lines $A_1A_2, A_3A_4$ and $T_2T_4$ are concurrent if and only if the lines $A_2A_3, A_4A_1$ and $T_1T_3$ are concurrent.
