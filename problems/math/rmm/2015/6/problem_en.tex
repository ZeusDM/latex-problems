Given a positive integer $n$, determine the largest real number $\mu$ satisfying the following condition: for every set $C$ of $4n$ points in the interior of the unit square $U$, there exists a rectangle $T$ contained in $U$ such that
\begin{itemize}
	\item the sides of $T$ are parallel to the sides of $U$;
	\item the interior of $T$ contains exactly one point of $C$;
	\item the area of $T$ is at least $\mu$.
\end{itemize}
