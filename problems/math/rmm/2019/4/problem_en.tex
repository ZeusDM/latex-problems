Prove that for every positive integer $n$ there exists a (not necessarily convex) polygon with no three collinear vertices, which admits exactly $n$ diffferent triangulations.

(A \emph{triangulation} is a dissection of the polygon into triangles by interior diagonals which have no common interior points with each other nor with the sides of the polygon.)
