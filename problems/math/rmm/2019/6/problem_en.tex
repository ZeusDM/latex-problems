Find all pairs of integers $(c, d)$, both greater than 1, such that the following holds:

For any monic polynomial $Q$ of degree $d$ with integer coefficients and for any prime $p > c(2c+1)$, there exists a set $S$ of at most $\big(\tfrac{2c-1}{2c+1}\big)p$ integers, such that
\[\bigcup_{s \in S} \{s,\; Q(s),\; Q(Q(s)),\; Q(Q(Q(s))),\; \dots\}\]
contains a complete residue system modulo $p$ (i.e., intersects with every residue class modulo $p$).
