Find all pairs of integers $(c, d)$, both greater than $1$, such that the following holds:
For any monic polynomial $Q$ of degree $d$ with integer coefficients and
for any prime $p > c(2c+1)$, there exists a set $S$ of at most
$\left(\dfrac{2c-1}{2c+1}\right)p$ integers,
such that 
$$ \bigcup_{s\in S} \left\{s, Q(s), Q(Q(s)), Q(Q(Q(s))), \dots\right\}$$
is a complete residue system modulo $p$ (i.e., intersects with every residue
class modulo $p$).
