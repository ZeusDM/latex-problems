Let $ABCD$ be an isosceles trapezoid with $AB\parallel CD$. Let $E$ be the midpoint of $AC$. Denote by $\omega$ and $\Omega$ the circumcircles of the triangles $ABE$ and $CDE$, respectively. Let $P$ be the crossing point of the tangent to $\omega$ at $A$ with the tangent to $\Omega$ at $D$. Prove that $PE$ is tangent to $\Omega$.
