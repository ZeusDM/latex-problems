Given  any  positive  real  number $\epsilon$,  prove  that,  for  all  but  finitely  many  positive integers $v$, any graph on $v$ vertices with at least $(1+\epsilon)v$ edges has two distinct simple cycles of equal lengths.

(Recall that the notion of a simple cycle does not allow repetition of vertices in a cycle.)
