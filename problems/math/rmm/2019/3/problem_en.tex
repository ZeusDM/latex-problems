Given any positive real number $\varepsilon$, prove that, for all but finitely many positive integers $v$, any graph on $v$ vertices with at least  $(1+\varepsilon)v$ edges has two distinct simple cycles of equal lengths.

(Recall that the notion of a simple cycle does not allow repetition of vertices in a cycle.)
