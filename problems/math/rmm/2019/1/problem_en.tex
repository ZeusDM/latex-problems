Amy and Bob play the game. At the beginning, Amy writes down a positive integer on the board. Then the players take moves in turn, Bob moves first. On any move of his, Bob replaces the number $n$ on the blackboard with a number of the form $n-a^2$, where a is a positive integer. On any move of hers, Amy replaces the number $n$ on the blackboard with a number of the form $n^k$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Bob wins if the number on the board becomes zero.
