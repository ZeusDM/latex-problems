\playerA{Amy} and \playerB{Bob} play a game. 
At the beginning, \playerA{Amy} writes down a positive integer on the board.
Then the players take moves in turn, \playerB{Bob} moves first.
On any move of \playerB{Bob}, \playerB{Bob} replaces the number $n$ on the blackboard with a number of the form $n−a^2$, where $a$ is a positive integer.
On any move of \playerA{Amy}, \playerA{Amy} replaces the number $n$ on the blackboard with a number of the form $n^k$, where $k$ is a positive integer.
\playerB{Bob} wins if the number on the board becomes zero. Can \playerA{Amy} prevent \playerB{Bob}’s win?
