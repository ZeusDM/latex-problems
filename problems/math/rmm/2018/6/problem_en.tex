Fix a circle $\Gamma$, a line $\ell$ to tangent $\Gamma$, and another circle $\Omega$ disjoint from $\ell$ such that $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$ lie on opposite sides of $\ell$. The tangents to $\Gamma$ from a variable point $X$ on $\Omega$ cross $\ell$ at $Y$ and $Z$. Prove that, as $X$ traces $\Omega$, the circle $XYZ$ is tangent to two fixed circles.
