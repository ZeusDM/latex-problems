Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral an let $P$ be a point on the side $AB$.
The diagonals $AC$ meets the segments $DP$ at $Q$.
The line through $P$ parallel to $CD$ mmets the extension of the side $CB$ beyond $B$ at $K$.
The line through $Q$ parallel to $BD$ meets the extension of the side $CB$ beyond $B$ at $L$.
Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles $BKP$ and $CLQ$ are tangent.
