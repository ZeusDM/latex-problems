Let $n$ be positive integer and fix $2n$ distinct points on a circle. Determine the number of ways to connect the points with $n$ arrows (oriented line segments) such that all of the following conditions hold:

\begin{itemize}
	\item each of the $2n$ points is a startpoint or endpoint of an arrow;
	\item no two arrows intersect; and 
	\item there are no two arrows $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{CD}$ such that $A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$ appear in clockwise order around the circle (not necessarily consecutively). 
\end{itemize}
