Let $n$ be positive integer and fix $2n$ distinct points on a circumference. Split these points into $n$ pairs and join the points in each pair by an arrow (i.e., an oriented line segment). The resulting configuration is \emph{good} if no two arrows cross, and there are no arrows $\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\overrightarrow{CD}$ such that $ABCD$ is a convex quadrangle \emph{oriented clockwise}. Determine the number of good configurations.
