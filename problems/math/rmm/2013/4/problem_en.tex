Let $P$ and $P'$ be two convex quadrilateral regions in the plane (regions contain their boundary). Let them intersect, with $O$ a point in the intersection. Suppose that for every line $\ell$ through $O$ the segment $\ell\cap P$ is strictly longer than the segment $\ell\cap P'$. Is it possible that the ratio of the area of $P'$ to the area of $P$ is greater than $1.9$?
