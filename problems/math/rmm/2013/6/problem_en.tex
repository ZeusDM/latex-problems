$2n$ distinct tokens are placed at the vertices of a regular $2n$-gon, with one token placed at each vertex. A \emph{move} consists of choosing an edge of the $2n$-gon and interchanging the two tokens at the endpoints of that edge. Suppose that after a finite number of moves, every pair of tokens have been interchanged exactly once. Prove that some edge has never been chosen.
