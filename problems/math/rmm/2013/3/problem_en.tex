Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle $\omega$. The lines $AB$ and $CD$ meet at $P$, the lines $AD$ and $BC$ meet at $Q$, and the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ meet at $R$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of the segment $PQ$, and let $K$ be the common point of the segment $MR$ and the circle $\omega$. Prove that the circumcircle of the triangle $KPQ$ and $\omega$ are tangent to one another.
