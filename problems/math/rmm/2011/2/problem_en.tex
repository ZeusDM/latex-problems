Determine all positive integers $n$ for which there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ with real coefficients, with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\arabic*)]
	\item for each integer $k$, the number $f(k)$ is an integer if and only if $k$ is not divisible by $n$;
	\item the degree of $f$ is less than $n$.
\end{enumerate}
