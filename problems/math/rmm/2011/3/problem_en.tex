A triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in a circle $\omega$. A variable line $\ell$ chosen parallel to $BC$ meets segments $AB$, $AC$ at points $D$, $E$ respectively, and meets $\omega$ at points $K$, $L$ (where $D$ lies between $K$ and $E$). Circle $\gamma_1$ is tangent to the segments $KD$ and $BD$ and also tangent to $\omega$, while circle $\gamma_2$ is tangent to the segments $LE$ and $CE$ and also tangent to $\omega$. Determine the locus, as $\ell$ varies, of the meeting point of the common inner tangents to $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$.
