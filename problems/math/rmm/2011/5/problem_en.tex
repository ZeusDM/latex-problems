For every $n\geq 3$, determine all the configurations of $n$ distinct points $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ in the plane, with the property that for any pair of distinct points $X_i$, $X_j$ there exists a permutation $\sigma$ of the integers $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, such that $d(X_i,X_k) = d(X_j,X_{\sigma(k)})$ for all $1\leq k \leq n$.

(We write $d(X,Y)$ to denote the distance between points $X$ and $Y$.)
