Let $ABC$ be a triangle with a right angle at $C$. Let $I$ be the incentre of triangle $ABC$,  and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$ to $AB$. The incircle $\omega$ of triangle $ABC$ is tangent to sides $BC$,  $CA$,  and $AB$ at $A_1$,  $B_1$,  and $C_1$,  respectively. Let $E$ and $F$ be the reflections of $C$ in lines $C_1A_1$ and $C_1B_1$,  respectively. Let $K$ and $L$ be the reflections of $D$ in lines $C_1A_1$ and $C_1B_1$,  respectively.

Prove that the circumcircles of triangles $A_1EI$,  $B_1FI$,  and $C_1KL$ have a common point.
