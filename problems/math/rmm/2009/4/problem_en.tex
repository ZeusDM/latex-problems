For a finite set $ X$ of positive integers, let $ \Sigma(X) = \sum_{x \in X} \arctan \frac{1}{x}.$ Given a finite set $ S$ of positive integers for which $ \Sigma(S) < \frac{\pi}{2},$ show that there exists at least one finite set $ T$ of positive integers for which $ S \subset T$ and $ \Sigma(S) = \frac{\pi}{2}$.
