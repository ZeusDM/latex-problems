A set $ S$ of points in space satisfies the property that all pairwise distances between points in $ S$ are distinct. Given that all points in $ S$ have integer coordinates $ (x,y,z)$ where $ 1 \leq x,y, z \leq n,$ show that the number of points in $ S$ is less than $ \min \left((n + 2)\sqrt {\frac {n}{3}}, n \sqrt {6}\right).$
