Fix an integer $n \geq 2$. An $n\times n$ sieve is an $n\times n$ array with $n$ cells removed so that exactly one cell is removed from every row and every column. A stick is a $1\times k$ or $k\times 1$ array for any positive integer $k$. For any sieve $A$, let $m(A)$ be the minimal number of sticks required to partition $A$. Find all possible values of $m(A)$, as $A$ varies over all possible $n\times n$ sieves.
