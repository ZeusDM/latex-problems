Let $ABCD$ be any convex quadrilateral and let $P, Q, R, S$ be points on the segments $AB, BC, CD$, and $DA$, respectively. It is given that the segments $PR$ and $QS$ dissect $ABCD$ into four quadrilaterals, each of which has perpendicular diagonals. Show that the points $P, Q, R, S$ are concyclic.
