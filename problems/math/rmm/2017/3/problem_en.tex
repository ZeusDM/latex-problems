Let $n$ be an integer greater than $1$ and let $X$ be an n-element set. A non-empty collection of subsets $A_1,\ldots, A_k$ of $X$ is tight if the union $A_1 \cup \cdots  \cup A_k$ is a proper subset of $X$ and no element of $X$ lies in exactly one of the $A_i$s. Find the largest cardinality of a collection of proper non-empty subsets of $X$, no non-empty subcollection of which is tight.

\emph{Note.} A subset $A$ of $X$ is \emph{proper} if $A\neq X$. The sets in a collection are assumed to be distinct. The whole collection is assumed to be a subcollection.
