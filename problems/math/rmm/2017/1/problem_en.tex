\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Prove that every positive integer $n$ can be written uniquely in the form \[n=\sum_{j=1}^{2k+1}(-1)^{j-1}2^{m_j},\] where $k\geq 0$ and $0\le m_1<m_2<\cdots <m_{2k+1}$ are integers.
	
	This number $k$ is called \emph{weight} of $n$.
	
	\item Find (in closed form) the difference between the number of positive integers at most $2^{2017}$ with even weight and the number of positive integers at most $2^{2017}$ with odd weight.
\end{enumerate}
