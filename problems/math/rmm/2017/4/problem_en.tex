In the Cartesian plane, let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be the graphs of the quadratic functions $f_1(x) = p_1x^2 + q_1x + r_1$ and $f_2(x) = p_2x^2 + q_2x + r_2$, where $p_1 > 0 > p_2$.
The graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ cross at distinct points $A$ and $B$.
The four tangents to $G_1$ and $G_2$ at $A$ and $B$ form a convex quadrilateral which has an inscribed circle.
Prove that the graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ have the same axis of symmetry.
