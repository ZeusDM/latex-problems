In the Cartesian plane, let $\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\mathcal{G}_2$ be the graphs of the quadratic functions $f_1(x) = p_1x^2 + q_1x + r_1$ and $f_2(x) = p_2x^2 + q_2x + r_2$, where $p_1 > 0 > p_2$. The graphs $\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\mathcal{G}_2$ cross at distinct points $A$ and $B$. The four tangents to $\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\mathcal{G}_2$ at $A$ and $B$ form a convex quadrilateral which has an inscribed circle. Prove that the graphs $\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\mathcal{G}_2$ have the same axis of symmetry.
