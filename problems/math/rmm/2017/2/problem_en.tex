Determine all positive integers $n$ satisfying the following condition:
for every monic polynomial $P$ of degree at most $n$ with integer coefficients, there exists a positive integer $k\le n$ and $k+1$ distinct integers $x_1,x_2,\dots ,x_{k+1}$ such that \[P(x_1)+P(x_2)+\cdots +P(x_k)=P(x_{k+1}).\]

\note{A polynomial is \textit{monic} if the coefficient of the highest power is one.}
