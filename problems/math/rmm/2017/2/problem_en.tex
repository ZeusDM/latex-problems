Determine all positive integers $n$ satisfying the following condition: for every monic polynomial $P$ of degree at most $n$ with integer coefficients, there exists a positive integer $k\le n$ and $k+1$ distinct integers $x_1,x_2,\cdots ,x_{k+1}$ such that \[P(x_1)+P(x_2)+\cdots +P(x_k)=P(x_{k+1}).\]

\emph{Note. }A polynomial is \emph{monic} if the coefficient of the highest power is one.
