The incircle of a triangle $ABC$ touches the sides $BC$ and $AC$ at points $D$ and $E$,  respectively. Suppose $P$ is the point on the shorter arc $DE$ of the incircle such that $\angle APE = \angle DPB$. The segments $AP$ and $BP$ meet the segment $DE$ at points $K$ and $L$,  respectively. Prove that $2KL = DE$.Dušan Djukić
