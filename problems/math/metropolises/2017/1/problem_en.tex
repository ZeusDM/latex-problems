Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram in which angle at $B$ is obtuse and $AD>AB$. Points $K$ and $L$ on $AC$ such that $\angle ADL=\angle KBA$(the points $A, K, C, L$ are all different, with $K$ between $A$ and $L$). The line $BK$ intersects the circumcircle $\omega$ of $ABC$ at points $B$ and $E$,  and the line $EL$ intersects $\omega$ at points $E$ and $F$. Prove that $BF||AC$.
