In a non-equilateral triangle $ABC$ point $I$ is the incenter and point $O$ is the circumcenter. A line $s$ through $I$ is perpendicular to $IO$. Line $\ell$ symmetric to like $BC$ with respect to $s$ meets the segments $AB$ and $AC$ at points $K$ and $L$,  respectively ($K$ and $L$ are different from $A$). Prove that the circumcenter of triangles $AKL$ lies on the line $IO$.
