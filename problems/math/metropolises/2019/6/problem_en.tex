Let $p$ be a prime and let $f(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $d$ with integer coefficients. Assume that the numbers $f(1),f(2),\dots,f(p)$ leave exactly $k$ distinct remainders when divided by $p$,  and $1<k<p$. Prove that\[ \frac{p-1}{d}\leq k-1\leq (p-1)\left(1-\frac1d \right) .\] Dániel Domán, Gauls Károlyi, and Emil Kiss
