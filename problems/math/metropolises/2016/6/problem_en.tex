In a country with $n$ cities, some pairs of cities are connected by one-way flights operated by one of two companies $A$ and $B$. Two cities can be connected by more than one flight in either direction. An $AB$-word $w$ is called implementable if there is a sequence of connected flights whose companiesâ€™ names form the word $w$. Given that every $AB$-word of length $ 2^n $ is implementable, prove that every finite $AB$-word is implementable. (An $AB$-word of length $k$ is an arbitrary sequence of $k$ letters $A $ or $B$; e.g. $ AABA $ is a word of length $4$.)
