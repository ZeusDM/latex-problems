Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=2$ and $AC=3$. Let $H$ be the orthocenter, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Let the line through $H$ perpendicular to line $AM$ intersect line $AB$ at $X$ and line $AC$ at $Y$. Suppose that lines $BY$ and $CX$ are parallel. Then $[ABC]^2=\frac{a+b\sqrt{c}}{d}$ for positive integers $a,b,c$ and $d$, where $\gcd(a,b,d)=1$ and $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Compute $1000a+100b+10c+d$.
