Leonhard has five cards. Each card has a nonnegative integer written on it, and any two cards show relatively prime numbers. Compute the smallest possible value of the sum of the numbers on Leonhard's cards.

Note: Two integers are relatively prime if no positive integer other than $1$ divides both numbers.
