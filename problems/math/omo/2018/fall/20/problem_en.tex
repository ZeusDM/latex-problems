For positive integers $k,n$ with $k\leq n$, we say that a $k$-tuple $\left(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k\right)$ of positive integers is \emph{tasty} if
\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}
For some positive integer $n$, there are more than $2018$ tasty tuples as $k$ ranges through $2,3,\ldots,n$. Compute the least possible number of tasty tuples there can be.

Note: For a positive integer $m$, $[m]$ is taken to denote the set $\left\{1,2,\ldots,m\right\}$.
