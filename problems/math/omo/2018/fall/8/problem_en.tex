Let $ABC$ be the triangle with vertices located at the center of masses of Vincent Huang's house, Tristan Shin's house, and Edward Wan's house; here, assume the three are not collinear. Let $N = 2017$, and define the $A$-\emph{ntipodes} to be the points $A_1,\dots, A_N$ to be the points on segment $BC$ such that $BA_1 = A_1A_2 = \cdots = A_{N-1}A_N = A_NC$, and similarly define the $B$, $C$-ntipodes. A line $\ell_A$ through $A$ is called a \emph{qevian} if it passes through an $A$-ntipode, and similarly we define qevians through $B$ and $C$. Compute the number of ordered triples $(\ell_A, \ell_B, \ell_C)$ of concurrent qevians through $A$, $B$, $C$, respectively.
