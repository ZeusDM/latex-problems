Let $p = 2027$ be the smallest prime greater than $2018$, and let $P(X) = X^{2031}+X^{2030}+X^{2029}-X^5-10X^4-10X^3+2018X^2$. Let $\mathrm{GF}(p)$ be the integers modulo $p$, and let $\mathrm{GF}(p)(X)$ be the set of rational functions with coefficients in $\mathrm{GF}(p)$ (so that all coefficients are taken modulo $p$). That is, $\mathrm{GF}(p)(X)$ is the set of fractions $\frac{P(X)}{Q(X)}$ of polynomials with coefficients in $\mathrm{GF}(p)$, where $Q(X)$ is not the zero polynomial. Let $D\colon \mathrm{GF}(p)(X)\to \mathrm{GF}(p)(X)$ be a function satisfying \[
	  D\left(\frac fg\right) = \frac{D(f)\cdot g - f\cdot D(g)}{g^2}
\]for any $f,g\in \mathrm{GF}(p)(X)$ with $g\neq 0$, and such that for any nonconstant polynomial $f$, $D(f)$ is a polynomial with degree less than that of $f$. If the number of possible values of $D(P(X))$ can be written as $a^b$, where $a$, $b$ are positive integers with $a$ minimized, compute $ab$.
