Patchouli is taking an exam with $k > 1$ parts, numbered Part $1, 2, \dots, k$. It is known that for $i = 1, 2, \dots, k$, Part $i$ contains $i$ multiple choice questions, each of which has $(i+1)$ answer choices. It is known that if she guesses randomly on every single question, the probability that she gets exactly one question correct is equal to $2018$ times the probability that she gets no questions correct. Compute the number of questions that are on the exam.
