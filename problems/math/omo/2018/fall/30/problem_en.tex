Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $\cos B =\frac{1}{3}, \cos C =\frac{1}{4}$, and circumradius $72$. Let $ABC$ have circumcenter $O$, symmedian point $K$, and nine-point center $N$. Consider all non-degenerate hyperbolas $\mathcal H$ with perpendicular asymptotes passing through $A,B,C$. Of these $\mathcal H$, exactly one has the property that there exists a point $P\in \mathcal H$ such that $NP$ is tangent to $\mathcal H$ and $P\in OK$. Let $N'$ be the reflection of $N$ over $BC$. If $AK$ meets $PN'$ at $Q$, then the length of $PQ$ can be expressed in the form $a+b\sqrt{c}$, where $a,b,c$ are positive integers such that $c$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Compute $100a+b+c$.
