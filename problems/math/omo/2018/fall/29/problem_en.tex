For integers $0 \le m,n \le 2^{2017}-1$, let $\alpha(m,n)$ be the number of nonnegative integers $k$ for which $\left\lfloor m/2^k \right\rfloor$ and $\left\lfloor n/2^k \right\rfloor$ are both odd integers.  Consider a $2^{2017} \times 2^{2017}$ matrix $M$ whose $(i,j)$th entry (for $1 \le i, j \le 2^{2017}$) is \[ (-1)^{\alpha(i-1, j-1)}. \] For $1 \le i, j \le 2^{2017}$, let $M_{i,j}$ be the matrix with the same entries as $M$ except for the $(i,j)$th entry, denoted by $a_{i,j}$, and such that $\det M_{i,j}=0$. Suppose that $A$ is the $2^{2017} \times 2^{2017}$ matrix whose $(i,j)$th entry is $a_{i,j}$ for all $1 \le i, j \le 2^{2017}$. Compute the remainder when $\det A$ is divided by $2017$.
