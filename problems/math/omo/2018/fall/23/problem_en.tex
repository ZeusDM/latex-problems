Consider all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of positive integers such that $\frac{a^2 + b^2 + 2}{ab}$ is an integer and $a\le b$. We label all such pairs in increasing order by their distance from the origin. (It is guaranteed that no ties exist.) Thus $P_1 = (1, 1), P_2 = (1, 3)$, and so on. If $P_{2020} = (x, y),$ then compute the remainder when $x + y$ is divided by $2017$.
