A hyperbola in the coordinate plane passing through the points $(2,5)$, $(7,3)$, $(1,1)$, and $(10,10)$ has an asymptote of slope $\frac{20}{17}$. The slope of its other asymptote can be expressed in the form $-\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100m+n$.
