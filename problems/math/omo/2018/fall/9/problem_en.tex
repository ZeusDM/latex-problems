Ann and Drew have purchased a mysterious slot machine; each time it is spun, it chooses a random positive integer such that $k$ is chosen with probability $2^{-k}$ for every positive integer $k$, and then it outputs $k$ tokens. Let $N$ be a fixed integer. Ann and Drew alternate turns spinning the machine, with Ann going first. Ann wins if she receives at least $N$ total tokens from the slot machine before Drew receives at least $M=2^{2018}$ total tokens, and Drew wins if he receives $M$ tokens before Ann receives $N$ tokens. If each person has the same probability of winning, compute the remainder when $N$ is divided by $2018$.
