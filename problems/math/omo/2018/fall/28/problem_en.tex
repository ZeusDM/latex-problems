Let $\omega$ be a circle centered at $O$ with radius $R=2018$. For any $0 < r < 1009$, let $\gamma$ be a circle of radius $r$ centered at a point $I$ satisfying $OI =\sqrt{R(R-2r)}$. Choose any $A,B,C\in \omega$ with $AC, AB$ tangent to $\gamma$ at $E,F$, respectively. Suppose a circle of radius $r_A$ is tangent to $AB,AC$, and internally tangent to $\omega$ at a point $D$ with $r_A=5r$. Let line $EF$ meet $\omega$ at $P_1,Q_1$. Suppose $P_2,P_3,Q_2,Q_3$ lie on $\omega$ such that $P_1P_2,P_1P_3,Q_1Q_2,Q_1Q_3$ are tangent to $\gamma$. Let $P_2P_3,Q_2Q_3$ meet at $K$, and suppose $KI$ meets $AD$ at a point $X$. Then as $r$ varies from $0$ to $1009$, the maximum possible value of $OX$ can be expressed in the form $\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a,b,c$ are positive integers such that $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime and $\gcd (a,c)=1$. Compute $10a+b+c$.
