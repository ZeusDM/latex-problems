Players $1,2,\ldots,10$ are playing a game on Christmas. Santa visits each player's house according to a set of rules:

\begin{itemize}
	  \item Santa first visits player $1$. After visiting player $i$, Santa visits player $i+1$, where player $11$ is the same as player $1$.
	  \item Every time Santa visits someone, he gives them either a present or a piece of coal (but not both).
	  \item The absolute difference between the number of presents and pieces of coal that Santa has given out is at most $3$ at every point in time.
	  \item If Santa has a choice between giving out a present and a piece of coal, he chooses with equal probability.
\end{itemize}

Let $p$ be the probability that player $1$ gets a present before player $2$ does. If $p=\frac{m}{n}$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$, then compute $100m+n$.
