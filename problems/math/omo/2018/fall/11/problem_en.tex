Let an ordered pair of positive integers $(m, n)$ be called \emph{regimented} if for all nonnegative integers $k$, the numbers $m^k$ and $n^k$ have the same number of positive integer divisors. Let $N$ be the smallest positive integer such that $\left(2016^{2016}, N\right)$ is regimented. Compute the largest positive integer $v$ such that $2^v$ divides the difference $2016^{2016}-N$.
