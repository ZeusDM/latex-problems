On Lineland there are 2018 bus stations numbered 1 through 2018 from left to right. A self-driving bus that can carry at most $N$ passengers starts from station 1 and drives all the way to station 2018, while making a stop at each bus station. Each passenger that gets on the bus at station $i$ will get off at station $j$ for some $j>i$ (the value of $j$ may vary over different passengers). Call any group of four distinct stations $i_1, i_2, j_1, j_2$ with $i_u< j_v$ for all $u,v\in \{1,2\}$ a \emph{good} group. Suppose that in any good group $i_1, i_2, j_1, j_2$, there is a passenger who boards at station $i_1$ and de-boards at station $j_1$, or there is a passenger who boards at station $i_2$ and de-boards at station $j_2$, or both scenarios occur. Compute the minimum possible value of $N$.
