Let $p=2^{16}+1$ be a prime. Let $N$ be the number of ordered tuples $(A,B,C,D,E,F)$ of integers between $0$ and $p-1$, inclusive, such that there exist integers $x,y,z$ not all divisible by $p$ with $p$ dividing all three of $Ax+Ez+Fy, By+Dz+Fx, Cz+Dy+Ex$. Compute the remainder when $N$ is divided by $10^6$.
