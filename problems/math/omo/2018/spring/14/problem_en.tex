Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=20$ and $AC=18$. $E$ is on segment $AC$ and $F$ is on segment $AB$ such that $AE=AF=8$. Let $BE$ and $CF$ intersect at $G$. Given that $AEGF$ is cyclic, then $BC=m\sqrt{n}$ for positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Compute $100m+n$.
