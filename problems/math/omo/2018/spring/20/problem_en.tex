Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB = 7, BC = 5,$ and $CA = 6$. Let $D$ be a variable point on segment $BC$, and let the perpendicular bisector of $AD$ meet segments $AC, AB$ at $E, F,$ respectively. It is given that there is a point $P$ inside $\triangle ABC$ such that $\frac{AP}{PC} = \frac{AE}{EC}$ and $\frac{AP}{PB} = \frac{AF}{FB}$. The length of the path traced by $P$ as $D$ varies along segment $BC$ can be expressed as $\sqrt{\frac{m}{n}}\sin^{-1}\left(\sqrt \frac 17\right)$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, and angles are measured in radians. Compute $100m + n$.
