Let $p = 2017$. Given a positive integer $n$, an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ is formed with each element $a_{ij}$ randomly selected, with equal probability, from $\{0, 1, \ldots, p - 1\}$. Let $q_n$ be probability that $\det A\equiv 1\pmod{p}$. Let $q=\displaystyle\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} q_n$. If $d_1, d_2, d_3, \ldots$ are the digits after the decimal point in the base $p$ expansion of $q$, then compute the remainder when $\displaystyle\sum_{k = 1}^{p^2} d_k$ is divided by $10^9$.
