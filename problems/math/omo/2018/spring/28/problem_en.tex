In $\triangle ABC$, the incircle $\omega$ has center $I$ and is tangent to $\overline{CA}$ and $\overline{AB}$ at $E$ and $F$ respectively. The circumcircle of $\triangle{BIC}$ meets $\omega$ at $P$ and $Q$. Lines $AI$ and $BC$ meet at $D$, and the circumcircle of $\triangle PDQ$ meets $\overline{BC}$ again at $X$. Suppose that $EF = PQ = 16$ and $PX + QX = 17$. Then $BC^2$ can be expressed as $\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $100m + n$.
