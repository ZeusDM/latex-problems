Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incenter $I$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be points such that $IP\perp AC$, $IQ\perp AB$, and $IA\perp PQ$. Assume that $BP$ and $CQ$ intersect at the point $R\neq A$ on the circumcircle of $ABC$ such that $AR\parallel BC$. Given that $\angle B-\angle C=36^\circ$, the value of $\cos A$ can be expressed in the form $\frac{m-\sqrt n}{p}$ for positive integers $m,n,p$ and where $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find the value of $100m+10n+p$.
