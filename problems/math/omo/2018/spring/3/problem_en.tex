Hen Hao randomly selects two distinct squares on a standard $8\times 8$ chessboard. Given that the two squares touch (at either a vertex or a side), the probability that the two squares are the same color can be expressed in the form $\frac mn$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$. Find $100m+n$.
