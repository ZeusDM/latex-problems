Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers. Fuming Zeng gives James a rectangle, such that $m-1$ lines are drawn parallel to one pair of sides and $n-1$ lines are drawn parallel to the other pair of sides (with each line distinct and intersecting the interior of the rectangle), thus dividing the rectangle into an $m\times n$ grid of smaller rectangles. Fuming Zeng chooses $m+n-1$ of the $mn$ smaller rectangles and then tells James the area of each of the smaller rectangles. Of the $\dbinom{mn}{m+n-1}$ possible combinations of rectangles and their areas Fuming Zeng could have given, let $C_{m,n}$ be the number of combinations which would allow James to determine the area of the whole rectangle. Given that \[A=\sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{C_{m,n}\binom{m+n}{m}}{(m+n)^{m+n}},\] then find the greatest integer less than $1000A$.
