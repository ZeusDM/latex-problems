Kevin has $255$ cookies, each labeled with a unique nonempty subset of $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$. Each day, he chooses one cookie uniformly at random out of the cookies not yet eaten. Then, he eats that cookie, and all remaining cookies that are labeled with a subset of that cookie (for example, if he chooses the cookie labeled with $\{1,2\}$, he eats that cookie as well as the cookies with $\{1\}$ and $\{2\}$). The expected value of the number of days that Kevin eats a cookie before all cookies are gone can be expressed in the form $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.
