Ben has a big blackboard, initially empty, and Francisco has a fair coin. Francisco flips the coin $2013$ times. On the $n^{\text{th}}$ flip (where $n=1,2,\dots,2013$), Ben does the following if the coin flips heads:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item If the blackboard is empty, Ben writes $n$ on the blackboard.
	\item If the blackboard is not empty,
	let $m$ denote the largest number on the blackboard.  
	If $m^2+2n^2$ is divisible by $3$, Ben erases $m$ from the blackboard;
	otherwise, he writes the number $n$.
\end{enumerate}
No action is taken when the coin flips tails. If probability that the blackboard is empty after all $2013$ flips is $\frac{2u+1}{2^k(2v+1)}$, where $u$, $v$, and $k$ are nonnegative integers, compute $k$.
