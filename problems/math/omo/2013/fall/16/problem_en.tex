Al has the cards $1,2,\dots,10$ in a row in increasing order. He first chooses the cards labeled $1$, $2$, and $3$, and rearranges them among their positions in the row in one of six ways (he can leave the positions unchanged). He then chooses the cards labeled $2$, $3$, and $4$, and rearranges them among their positions in the row in one of six ways. (For example, his first move could have made the sequence $3,2,1,4,5,\dots,$ and his second move could have rearranged that to $2,4,1,3,5,\dots$.) He continues this process until he has rearranged the cards with labels $8$, $9$, $10$. Determine the number of possible orderings of cards he can end up with.
