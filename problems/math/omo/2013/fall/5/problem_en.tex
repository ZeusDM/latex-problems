A wishing well is located at the point $(11,11)$ in the $xy$-plane. Rachelle randomly selects an integer $y$ from the set $\left\{ 0, 1, \dots, 10 \right\}$.  Then she randomly selects, with replacement, two integers $a,b$ from the set $\left\{ 1,2,\dots,10 \right\}$.  The probability the line through $(0,y)$ and $(a,b)$ passes through the well can be expressed as $\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Compute $m+n$.
