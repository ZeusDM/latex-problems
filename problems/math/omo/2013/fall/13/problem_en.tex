In the rectangular table shown below, the number $1$ is written in the upper-left hand corner, and every number is the sum of the any numbers directly to its left and above.  The table extends infinitely downwards and to the right.
\[ 
	\begin{array}{cccccc}
	  1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & \cdots \\
	  1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & \cdots \\
	  1 & 3 & 6 & 10 & 15 & \cdots \\
	  1 & 4 & 10 & 20 & 35 & \cdots \\
	  1 & 5 & 15 & 35 & 70 & \cdots \\
	  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
	\end{array}

Wanda the Worm, who is on a diet after a feast two years ago, wants to eat $n$ numbers (not necessarily distinct in value) from the table such that the sum of the numbers is less than one million. However, she cannot eat two numbers in the same row or column (or both). What is the largest possible value of $n$?
