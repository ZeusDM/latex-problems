A \emph{palindromic table} is a $3 \times 3$ array of letters such that the words in each row and column read the same forwards and backwards. An example of such a table is shown below. 
\[ \begin{array}[h]{ccc}
	O & M & O \\
	N & M & N \\
	O & M & O
\end{array} \]
How many palindromic tables are there that use only the letters $O$ and $M$?  (The table may contain only a single letter.)
