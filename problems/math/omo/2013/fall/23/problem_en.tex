Let $ABCDE$ be a regular pentagon, and let $F$ be a point on $\overline{AB}$ with $\angle CDF=55^\circ$.  Suppose $\overline{FC}$ and $\overline{BE}$ meet at $G$, and select $H$ on the extension of $\overline{CE}$ past $E$ such that $\angle DHE=\angle FDG$. Find the measure of $\angle GHD$, in degrees.
