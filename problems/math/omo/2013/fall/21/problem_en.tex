Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB = 5$, $AC = 8$, and $BC = 7$. Let $D$ be on side $AC$ such that $AD = 5$ and $CD = 3$. Let $I$ be the incenter of triangle $ABC$ and $E$ be the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of $\overline{ID}$ and $\overline{BC}$.  Suppose $DE = \frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}$ where $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime positive integers, and $b$ is a positive integer not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a+b+c$.
