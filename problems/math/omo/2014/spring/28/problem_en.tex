In the game of Nim, players are given several piles of stones. On each turn, a player picks a nonempty pile and removes any positive integer number of stones from that pile. The player who removes the last stone wins, while the first player who cannot move loses.

Alice, Bob, and Chebyshev play a 3-player version of Nim where each player wants to win but avoids losing at all costs (there is always a player who neither wins nor loses). Initially, the piles have sizes $43$, $99$, $x$, $y$, where $x$ and $y$ are positive integers. Assuming that the first player loses when all players play optimally, compute the maximum possible value of $xy$.
