Joe the teacher is bad at rounding. Because of this, he has come up with his own way to round grades, where a \emph{grade} is a nonnegative decimal number with finitely many digits after the decimal point.

Given a grade with digits $a_1a_2 \dots a_m.b_1b_2 \dots b_n$, Joe first rounds the number to the nearest $10^{-n+1}$th place. He then repeats the procedure on the new number, rounding to the nearest $10^{-n+2}$th, then rounding the result to the nearest $10^{-n+3}$th, and so on, until he obtains an integer.  For example, he rounds the number $2014.456$ via $2014.456 \to 2014.46 \to 2014.5 \to 2015$.

There exists a rational number $M$ such that a grade $x$ gets rounded to at least $90$ if and only if $x \ge M$.  If $M = \tfrac pq$ for relatively prime integers $p$ and $q$, compute $p+q$.
