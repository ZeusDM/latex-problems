Let $ABCD$ be a tetrahedron whose six side lengths are all integers, and let $N$ denote the sum of these side lengths. There exists a point $P$ inside $ABCD$ such that the feet from $P$ onto the faces of the tetrahedron are the orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$, centroid of $\triangle BCD$, circumcenter of $\triangle CDA$, and orthocenter of $\triangle DAB$. If $CD = 3$ and $N < 100{,}000$, determine the maximum possible value of $N$.
