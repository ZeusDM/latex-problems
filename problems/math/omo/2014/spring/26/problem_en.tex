Qing initially writes the ordered pair $(1,0)$ on a blackboard. Each minute, if the pair $(a,b)$ is on the board, she erases it and replaces it with one of the pairs $(2a-b,a)$, $(2a+b+2,a)$ or $(a+2b+2,b)$.  Eventually, the board reads $(2014,k)$ for some nonnegative integer $k$.  How many possible values of $k$ are there?
