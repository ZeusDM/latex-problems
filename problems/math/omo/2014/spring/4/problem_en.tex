The integers $1, 2, \dots, n$ are written in order on a long slip of paper. The slip is then cut into five pieces, so that each piece consists of some (nonempty) consecutive set of integers.  The averages of the numbers on the five slips are $1234$, $345$, $128$, $19$, and $9.5$ in some order.  Compute $n$.
