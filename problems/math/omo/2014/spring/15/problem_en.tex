In Prime Land, there are seven major cities, labelled $C_0$, $C_1$, \dots, $C_6$. For convenience, we let $C_{n+7} = C_n$ for each $n=0,1,\dots,6$; {i.e.} we take the indices modulo $7$.  Al initially starts at city $C_0$. 

Each minute for ten minutes, Al flips a fair coin.  If the coin land heads, and he is at city $C_k$, he moves to city $C_{2k}$; otherwise he moves to city $C_{2k+1}$.  If the probability that Al is back at city $C_0$ after $10$ moves is $\frac{m}{1024}$, find $m$.
