Let $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ be circles in the plane with centers $O_1$ and $O_2$ and radii $13$ and $10$, respectively. Assume $O_1O_2=2$.  Fix a circle $\Omega$ with radius $2$, internally tangent to $\Gamma_1$ at $P$ and externally tangent to $\Gamma_2$ at $Q$ . Let $\omega$ be a second variable circle internally tangent to $\Gamma_1$ at $X$ and externally tangent to $\Gamma_2$ at $Y$.  Line $PQ$ meets $\Gamma_2$ again at $R$, line $XY$ meets $\Gamma_2$ again at $Z$, and lines $PZ$ and $XR$ meet at $M$.

As $\omega$ varies, the locus of point $M$ encloses a region of area $\frac{p}{q} \pi$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Compute $p+q$.
