A frog starts at $0$ on a number line and plays a game. On each turn the frog chooses at random to jump $1$ or $2$ integers to the right or left. It stops moving if it lands on a nonpositive number or a number on which it has already landed. If the expected number of times it will jump is $\frac{p}{q}$ for relatively prime positive integers $p$ and $q$, find $p+q$.
