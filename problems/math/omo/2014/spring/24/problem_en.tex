Let $\mathcal P$ denote the set of planes in three-dimensional space with positive $x$, $y$, and $z$ intercepts summing to one. A point $(x,y,z)$ with $\min \{x,y,z\} > 0$ lies on exactly one plane in $\mathcal P$. What is the maximum possible integer value of $\left(\frac{1}{4} x^2 + 2y^2 + 16z^2\right)^{-1}$?
