A crazy physicist has discovered a new particle called an emon. He starts with two emons in the plane, situated a distance $1$ from each other. He also has a crazy machine which can take any two emons and create a third one in the plane such that the three emons lie at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. After he has five total emons, let $P$ be the product of the $\binom 52 = 10$ distances between the $10$ pairs of emons. Find the greatest possible value of $P^2$.
