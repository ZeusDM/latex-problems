Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcenter $O$, incenter $I$, and circumcircle $\Gamma$. It is known that $AB = 7$, $BC = 8$, $CA = 9$. Let $M$ denote the midpoint of major arc $\widehat{BAC}$ of $\Gamma$, and let $D$ denote the intersection of $\Gamma$ with the circumcircle of $\triangle IMO$ (other than $M$). Let $E$ denote the reflection of $D$ over line $IO$. Find the integer closest to $1000 \cdot \frac{BE}{CE}$.
