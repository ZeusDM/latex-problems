Let $B = (20, 14)$ and $C = (18, 0)$ be two points in the plane. For every line $\ell$ passing through $B$, we color red the foot of the perpendicular from $C$ to $\ell$.  The set of red points enclose a bounded region of area $\mathcal{A}$. Find $\lfloor \mathcal{A} \rfloor$ (that is, find the greatest integer not exceeding $\mathcal A$).
