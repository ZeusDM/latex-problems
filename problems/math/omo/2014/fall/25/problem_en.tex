Kevin has a set $S$ of $2014$ points scattered on an infinitely large planar gameboard. Because he is bored, he asks Ashley to evaluate
\[ x = 4f_4 + 6f_6 + 8f_8 + 10f_{10} + \cdots \]
while he evaluates
\[ y = 3f_3 + 5f_5+7f_7+9f_9 + \cdots, \]
where $f_k$ denotes the number of convex $k$-gons whose vertices lie in $S$ but none of whose interior points lie in $S$.
However, since Kevin wishes to one-up everything that Ashley does,
he secretly positions the points so that $y-x$ is as large as possible,
but in order to avoid suspicion, he makes sure no three points lie on a single line.
Find $\left\lvert y-x \right\rvert$.
