Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=26$, $AC=28$, $BC=30$. Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be the midpoints of arcs $BC$, $CA$, $AB$ (not containing the opposite vertices) respectively on the circumcircle of $ABC$. Let $P$ be the midpoint of arc $BC$ containing point $A$. Suppose lines $BP$ and $XZ$ meet at $M$ , while lines $CP$ and $XY$ meet at $N$. Find the square of the distance from $X$ to $MN$.
