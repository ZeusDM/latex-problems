For an olympiad geometry problem, Tina wants to draw an acute triangle whose angles each measure a multiple of $10^{\circ}$. She doesn't want her triangle to have any special properties, so none of the angles can measure $30^{\circ}$ or $60^{\circ}$, and the triangle should definitely not be isosceles.

How many different triangles can Tina draw? (Similar triangles are considered the same.)
