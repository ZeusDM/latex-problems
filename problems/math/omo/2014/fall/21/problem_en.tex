Consider a sequence $x_1,x_2,\cdots x_{12}$ of real numbers such that $x_1=1$ and for $n=1,2,\dots,10$ let \[ x_{n+2}=\frac{(x_{n+1}+1)(x_{n+1}-1)}{x_n}. \] Suppose $x_n>0$ for $n=1,2,\dots,11$ and $x_{12}=0$. Then the value of $x_2$ can be written as $\frac{\sqrt{a}+\sqrt{b}}{c}$ for positive integers $a,b,c$ with $a>b$ and no square dividing $a$ or $b$. Find $100a+10b+c$.
