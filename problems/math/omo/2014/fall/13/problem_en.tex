Two ducks, Wat and Q, are taking a math test with $1022$ other ducklings. The test has $30$ questions, and the $n$th question is worth $n$ points.  The ducks work independently on the test. Wat gets the $n$th problem correct with probability $\frac{1}{n^2}$ while Q gets the $n$th problem correct with probability $\frac{1}{n+1}$. Unfortunately, the remaining ducklings each answer all $30$ questions incorrectly.

Just before turning in their test, the ducks and ducklings decide to share answers! On any question which Wat and Q have the same answer, the ducklings change their answers to agree with them.  After this process, what is the expected value of the sum of all $1024$ scores?
