Let $A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5$ be a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle with area $\frac{5+\sqrt{5}}{10}\pi$. For each $i=1,2,\dots,5$, points $B_i$ and $C_i$ lie on ray $\overrightarrow{A_iA_{i+1}}$ such that
\[B_iA_i \cdot B_iA_{i+1} = B_iA_{i+2} \quad \text{and} \quad C_iA_i \cdot C_iA_{i+1} = C_iA_{i+2}^2\]where indices are taken modulo 5. The value of $\frac{[B_1B_2B_3B_4B_5]}{[C_1C_2C_3C_4C_5]}$ (where $[\mathcal P]$ denotes the area of polygon $\mathcal P$) can be expressed as $\frac{a+b\sqrt{5}}{c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, and $c > 0$ is as small as possible. Find $100a+10b+c$.
