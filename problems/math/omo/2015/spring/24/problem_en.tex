Suppose we have $10$ balls and $10$ colors. For each ball, we (independently) color it one of the $10$ colors, then group the balls together by color at the end. If $S$ is the expected value of the square of the number of distinct colors used on the balls, find the sum of the digits of $S$ written as a decimal.
