Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral satisfying $\angle BCD=\angle CDA$. Suppose rays $AD$ and $BC$ meet at $E$, and let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of $ABE$. Let $\Gamma_1$ be a circle tangent to ray $CD$ past $D$ at $W$, segment $AD$ at $X$, and internally tangent to $\Gamma$. Similarly, let $\Gamma_2$ be a circle tangent to ray $DC$ past $C$ at $Y$, segment $BC$ at $Z$, and internally tangent to $\Gamma$. Let $P$ be the intersection of $WX$ and $YZ$, and suppose $P$ lies on $\Gamma$. If $F$ is the $E$-excenter of triangle $ABE$, and $AB=544,AE=2197,BE=2299$, then find $m+n$, where $FP=\frac{m}{n}$ with $m,n$ relatively prime positive integers.
