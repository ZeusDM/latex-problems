Consider polynomials $P$ of degree $2015$, all of whose coefficients are in the set $\{0,1,\dots,2010\}$. Call such a polynomial \emph{good} if for every integer $m$, one of the numbers $P(m)-20$, $P(m)-15$, $P(m)-1234$ is divisible by $2011$, and there exist integers $m_{20}, m_{15}, m_{1234}$ such that $P(m_{20})-20, P(m_{15})-15, P(m_{1234})-1234$ are all multiples of $2011$. Let $N$ be the number of good polynomials. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
