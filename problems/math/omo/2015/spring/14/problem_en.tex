Let $ABCD$ be a square with side length $2015$.
A disk with unit radius is packed neatly inside corner $A$ (i.e. tangent to both $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AD}$).
Alice kicks the disk, which bounces off $\overline{CD}$, $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{DA}$, $\overline{DC}$ in that order, before landing neatly into corner $B$. What is the total distance the center of the disk travelled?
