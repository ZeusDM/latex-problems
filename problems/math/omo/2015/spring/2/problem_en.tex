A classroom has $30$ students, each of whom is either male or female. For every student $S$, we define his or her \emph{ratio} to be the number of students of the opposite gender as $S$ divided by the number of students of the same gender as $S$ (including $S$). Let $\Sigma$ denote the sum of the ratios of all $30$ students. Find the number of possible values of $\Sigma$.
