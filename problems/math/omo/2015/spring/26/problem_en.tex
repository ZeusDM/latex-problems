Consider a sequence $T_0, T_1, \dots$ of polynomials defined recursively by $T_0(x) = 2$, $T_1(x)=x$, and $T_{n+2}(x) = xT_{n+1}(x) - T_n(x)$ for each nonnegative integer $n$.  Let $L_n$ be the sequence of Lucas Numbers, defined by $L_0 = 2$, $L_1 = 1$, and $L_{n+2} = L_n+L_{n+1}$ for every nonnegative integer $n$. 

Find the remainder when $ T_0\left( L_0 \right) + T_1 \left( L_2 \right) + T_2 \left( L_4 \right) + \dots + T_{359} \left( L_{718} \right)$ is divided by $359$.
