Joe is given a permutation $p = (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_{5})$ of $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$. A \emph{swap} is an ordered pair $(i, j)$ with $1 \le i < j \le 5$, and this allows Joe to swap the positions $i$ and $j$ in the permutation. For example, if Joe starts with the permutation $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$, and uses the swaps $(1, 2)$ and $(1, 3)$, the permutation becomes
\[(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) \rightarrow (2, 1, 3, 4, 5) \rightarrow (3, 1, 2, 4, 5). \]
Out of all $\binom{5}{2} = 10$ swaps, Joe chooses $4$ of them to be in a set of swaps $S$. Joe notices that from $p$ he could reach any permutation of $(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$ using only the swaps in $S$. How many different sets are possible?
