At the Intergalactic Math Olympiad held in the year 9001, there are 6 problems, and on each problem you can earn an integer score from $0$ to $7$. The contestant's score is the 
\emph{product} of the scores on the 6 problems, and ties are broken by the sum of the 6 problems. If 2 contestants are still tied after this, their ranks are equal. In this olympiad, there are $8^6=262144$ participants, and no two get the same score on every problem. Find the score of the participant whose rank was $7^6 = 117649$.
