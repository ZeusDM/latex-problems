Let $A,B,M,C,D$ be distinct points on a line such that $AB=BM=MC=CD=6.$ Circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ with centers $O_1$ and $O_2$ and radius $4$ and $9$ are tangent to line $AD$ at $A$ and $D$ respectively such that $O_1,O_2$ lie on the same side of line $AD.$ Let $P$ be the point such that $PB\perp O_1M$ and $PC\perp O_2M.$ Determine the value of $PO_2^2-PO_1^2.$
