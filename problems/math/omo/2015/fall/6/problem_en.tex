Farmer John has a (flexible) fence of length $L$ and two straight walls that intersect at a corner perpendicular to each other. He knows that if he doesn't use any walls, he can enclose a maximum possible area of $A_0$, and when he uses one of the walls or both walls, he gets a maximum of area of $A_1$ and $A_2$ respectively. If $n=\frac{A_1}{A_0}+\frac{A_2}{A_1}$, find $\lfloor 1000n\rfloor$.
