Amandine and Brennon play a turn-based game, with Amadine starting.
On their turn, a player must select a positive integer which cannot be represented as a sum of multiples of any of the previously selected numbers.
For example, if $3, 5$ have been selected so far, only $1, 2, 4, 7$ are available to be picked;
if only $3$ has been selected so far, all numbers not divisible by three are eligible.
A player loses immediately if they select the integer $1$.

Call a number $n$ \emph{feminist} if $\gcd(n, 6) = 1$ and if Amandine wins if she starts with $n$. Compute the sum of the \emph{feminist} numbers less than $40$.
