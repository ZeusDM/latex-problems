For integers $0 \le m,n \le 64$, let $\alpha(m,n)$ be the number of nonnegative integers $k$ for which $\left\lfloor m/2^k \right\rfloor$ and $\left\lfloor n/2^k \right\rfloor$ are both odd integers.  Consider a $65 \times 65$ matrix $M$ whose $(i,j)$th entry (for $1 \le i, j \le 65$) is \[ (-1)^{\alpha(i-1, j-1)}. \] Compute the remainder when $\det M$ is divided by $1000$.
