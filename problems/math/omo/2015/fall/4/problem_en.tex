Let $\omega$ be a circle with diameter $AB$ and center $O$. We draw a circle $\omega_A$ through $O$ and $A$, and another circle $\omega_B$ through $O$ and $B$; the circles $\omega_A$ and $\omega_B$ intersect at a point $C$ distinct from $O$. Assume that all three circles $\omega$, $\omega_A$, $\omega_B$ are congruent. If $CO = \sqrt 3$, what is the perimeter of $\triangle ABC$?
