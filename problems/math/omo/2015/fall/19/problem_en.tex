For any set $S$, let $P(S)$ be its power set, the set of all of its subsets. Over all sets $A$ of $2015$ arbitrary finite sets, let $N$ be the maximum possible number of ordered pairs $(S,T)$ such that $S \in P(A), T \in P(P(A))$, $S \in T$, and $S \subseteq T$. (Note that by convention, a set may never contain itself.) Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$
