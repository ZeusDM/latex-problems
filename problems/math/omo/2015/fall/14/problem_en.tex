Let $a_1$, $a_2$, \dots, $a_{2015}$ be a sequence of positive integers in $[1,100]$.
Call a nonempty contiguous subsequence of this sequence \emph{good} if the product of the integers in it leaves a remainder of $1$ when divided by $101$.
In other words, it is a pair of integers $(x, y)$ such that $1 \le x \le y \le 2015$ and \[a_xa_{x+1}\dots a_{y-1}a_y \equiv 1 \pmod{101}. \]Find the minimum possible number of good subsequences across all possible $(a_i)$.
