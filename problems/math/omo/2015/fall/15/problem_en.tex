A regular $2015$-simplex $\mathcal P$ has $2016$ vertices in $2015$-dimensional space such that the distances between every pair of vertices are equal. Let $S$ be the set of points contained inside $\mathcal P$ that are closer to its center than any of its vertices. The ratio of the volume of $S$ to the volume of  $\mathcal P$ is $\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find the remainder when $m+n$ is divided by $1000$.
