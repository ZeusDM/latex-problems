Ryan is learning number theory. He reads about the \emph{M\"obius function} $\mu : \mathbb N \to \mathbb Z$, defined by $\mu(1)=1$ and
\[ \mu(n) = -\sum_{\substack{d\mid n \\ d \neq n}} \mu(d) \]
for $n>1$ (here $\mathbb N$ is the set of positive integers).
However, Ryan doesn't like negative numbers, so he invents his own function: the \emph{dubious function} $\delta : \mathbb N \to \mathbb N$, defined by the relations $\delta(1)=1$ and
\[ \delta(n) = \sum_{\substack{d\mid n \\ d \neq n}} \delta(d) \]
for $n > 1$. Help Ryan determine the value of $1000p+q$, where $p,q$ are relatively prime positive integers satisfying
\[ \frac{p}{q}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\delta(15^k)}{15^k}.  \]
