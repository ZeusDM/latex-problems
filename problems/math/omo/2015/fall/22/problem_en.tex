Let $W = \ldots x_{-1}x_0x_1x_2 \ldots$ be an infinite periodic word consisting of only the letters $a$ and $b$. The minimal period of $W$ is $2^{2016}$. Say that a word $U$ \emph{appears} in $W$ if there are indices $k \le \ell$ such that $U = x_kx_{k+1} \ldots x_{\ell}$. A word $U$ is called \emph{special} if $Ua, Ub, aU, bU$ all appear in $W$. (The empty word is considered special) You are given that there are no special words of length greater than 2015.

Let $N$ be the minimum possible number of special words. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.
