Toner Drum and Celery Hilton are both running for president. A total of $2015$ people cast their vote, giving $60\%$ to Toner Drum. Let $N$ be the number of ``representative'' sets of the $2015$ voters that could have been polled to correctly predict the winner of the election (i.e.\ more people in the set voted for Drum than Hilton). Compute the remainder when $N$ is divided by $2017$.
