Let $P(x,y)$ be a polynomial such that $\deg_x(P), \deg_y(P)\le 2020$ and \[P(i,j)=\binom{i+j}{i}\] over all $2021^2$ ordered pairs $(i,j)$ with $0\leq i,j\leq 2020$. Find the remainder when $P(4040, 4040)$ is divided by $2017$.

Note: $\deg_x (P)$ is the highest exponent of $x$ in a nonzero term of $P(x,y)$. $\deg_y (P)$ is defined similarly.
