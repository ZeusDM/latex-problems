Let $f$ be a random permutation on $\{1, 2, \dots, 100\}$ satisfying $f(1) > f(4)$ and $f(9)>f(16)$. The probability that $f(1)>f(16)>f(25)$ can be written as $\frac mn$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100m+n$.

Note: In other words, $f$ is a function such that $\{f(1), f(2), \ldots, f(100)\}$ is a permutation of $\{1,2, \ldots, 100\}$.
