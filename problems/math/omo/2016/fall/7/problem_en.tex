The $2016$ players in the Gensokyo Tennis Club are playing Up and Down the River. The players first randomly form $1008$ pairs, and each pair is assigned to a tennis court (The courts are numbered from $1$ to $1008$). Every day, the two players on the same court play a match against each other to determine a winner and a loser. For $2\le i\le 1008$, the winner on court $i$ will move to court $i-1$ the next day (and the winner on court $1$ does not move). Likewise, for $1\le j\le 1007$, the loser on court $j$ will move to court $j+1$ the next day (and the loser on court $1008$ does not move). On Day $1$, Reimu is playing on court $123$ and Marisa is playing on court $876$. Find the smallest positive integer value of $n$ for which it is possible that Reimu and Marisa play one another on Day $n$.
