For a positive integer $k$, define the sequence $\{a_n\}_{n\ge 0}$ such that $a_0=1$ and for all positive integers $n$, $a_n$ is the smallest positive integer greater than $a_{n-1}$ for which $a_n\equiv ka_{n-1}\pmod {2017}$. What is the number of positive integers $1\le k\le 2016$ for which $a_{2016}=1+\binom{2017}{2}?$
