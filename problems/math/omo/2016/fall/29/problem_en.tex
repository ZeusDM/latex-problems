Let $n$ be a positive integer. Yang the Saltant Sanguivorous Shearling is on the side of a very steep mountain that is embedded in the coordinate plane. There is a blood river along the line $y=x$, which Yang may reach but is not permitted to go above (i.e. Yang is allowed to be located at $(2016,2015)$ and $(2016,2016)$, but not at $(2016,2017)$). Yang is currently located at $(0,0)$ and wishes to reach $(n,0)$. Yang is permitted only to make the following moves:

\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In addition, whenever Yang does a \emph{sink}, he breaks his tiny little legs and may no longer do a \emph{spring} at any time afterwards. Yang also expends a lot of energy doing a \emph{spring} and gets bloodthirsty, so he must visit the blood river at least once afterwards to quench his bloodthirst. (So Yang may still \emph{spring} while bloodthirsty, but he may not finish his journey while bloodthirsty.) Let there be $a_n$ different ways for which Yang can reach $(n,0)$, given that Yang is permitted to pass by $(n,0)$ in the middle of his journey. Find the $2016$th smallest positive integer $n$ for which $a_n\equiv 1\pmod 5$.
