Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=3$ and $AC=4$. It is given that there does not exist a point $D$, different from $A$ and not lying on line $BC$, such that the Euler line of $ABC$ coincides with the Euler line of $DBC$. The square of the product of all possible lengths of $BC$ can be expressed in the form $m+n\sqrt p$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers and $p$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $100m+10n+p$.

Note: For this problem, consider every line passing through the center of an equilateral triangle to be an Euler line of the equilateral triangle. Hence, if $D$ is chosen such that $DBC$ is an equilateral triangle and the Euler line of $ABC$ passes through the center of $DBC$, then consider the Euler line of $ABC$ to coincide with "the" Euler line of $DBC$.
