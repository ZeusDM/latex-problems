Mark the Martian and Bark the Bartian live on planet Blok, in the year $2019$. Mark and Bark decide to play a game on a $10 \times 10$ grid of cells. First, Mark randomly generates a subset $S$ of $\{1, 2, \dots, 2019\}$ with $|S|=100$. Then, Bark writes each of the $100$ integers in a different cell of the $10 \times 10$ grid. Afterwards, Bark constructs a solid out of this grid in the following way: for each grid cell, if the number written on it is $n$, then she stacks $n$ $1 \times 1 \times 1$ blocks on top of one other in that cell. Let $B$ be the largest possible surface area of the resulting solid, including the bottom of the solid, over all possible ways Bark could have inserted the $100$ integers into the grid of cells. Find the expected value of $B$ over all possible sets $S$ Mark could have generated.
