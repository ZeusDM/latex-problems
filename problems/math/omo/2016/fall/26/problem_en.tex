Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $BC=9$, $CA=8$, and $AB=10$. Let the incenter and incircle of $ABC$ be $I$ and $\gamma$, respectively, and let $N$ be the midpoint of major arc $BC$ of the cirucmcircle of $ABC$. Line $NI$ meets the circumcircle of $ABC$ a second time at $P$. Let the line through $I$ perpendicular to $AI$ meet segments $AB$, $AC$, and $AP$ at $C_1$, $B_1$, and $Q$, respectively. Let $B_2$ lie on segment $CQ$ such that line $B_1B_2$ is tangent to $\gamma$, and let $C_2$ lie on segment $BQ$ such that line $C_1C_2$ tangent to $\gamma$. The length of $B_2C_2$ can be expressed in the form $\frac{m}{n}$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$. Determine $100m+n$.
