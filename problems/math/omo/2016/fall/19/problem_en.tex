Let $S$ be the set of all polynomials $Q(x,y,z)$ with coefficients in $\{0,1\}$ such that there exists a homogeneous polynomial $P(x,y,z)$ of degree $2016$ with integer coefficients and a polynomial $R(x,y,z)$ with integer coefficients so that \[P(x,y,z) Q(x,y,z) = P(yz,zx,xy)+2R(x,y,z)\] and $P(1,1,1)$ is odd. Determine the size of $S$.

Note: A homogeneous polynomial of degree $d$ consists solely of terms of degree $d$.
