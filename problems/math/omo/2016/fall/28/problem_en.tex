Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=34,BC=25,$ and $CA=39$. Let $O,H,$ and $ \omega$ be the circumcenter, orthocenter, and circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$, respectively. Let line $AH$ meet $\omega$ a second time at $A_1$ and let the reflection of $H$ over the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ be $H_1$. Suppose the line through $O$ perpendicular to $A_1O$ meets $\omega$ at two points $Q$ and $R$ with $Q$ on minor arc $AC$ and $R$ on minor arc $AB$. Denote $\mathcal H$ as the hyperbola passing through $A,B,C,H,H_1$, and suppose $HO$ meets $\mathcal H$ again at $P$. Let $X,Y$ be points with $XH \parallel AR \parallel YP, XP \parallel AQ \parallel YH$. Let $P_1,P_2$ be points on the tangent to $\mathcal H$ at $P$ with $XP_1 \parallel OH \parallel YP_2$ and let $P_3,P_4$ be points on the tangent to $\mathcal H$ at $H$ with $XP_3 \parallel OH \parallel YP_4$. If $P_1P_4$ and $P_2P_3$ meet at $N$, and $ON$ may be written in the form $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a,b$ are positive coprime integers, find $100a+b$.
