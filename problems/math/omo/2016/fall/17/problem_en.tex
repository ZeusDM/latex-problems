Let $n$ be a positive integer. $S$ is a set of points such that the points in $S$ are arranged in a regular $2016$-simplex grid, with an edge of the simplex having $n$ points in $S$. (For example, the $2$-dimensional analog would have $\dfrac{n(n+1)}{2}$ points arranged in an equilateral triangle grid). Each point in $S$ is labeled with a real number such that the following conditions hold:

\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that this is possible.

Note: A regular $2016$-simplex has $2017$ vertices in $2016$-dimensional space such that the distances between every pair of vertices are equal.
