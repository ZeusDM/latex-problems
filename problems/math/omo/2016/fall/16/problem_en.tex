For her zeroth project at Magic School, Emilia needs to grow six perfectly-shaped apple trees. First she plants six tree saplings at the end of Day $0$. On each day afterwards, Emilia attempts to use her magic to turn each sapling into a perfectly-shaped apple tree, and for each sapling she succeeds in turning it into a perfectly-shaped apple tree that day with a probability of $\frac{1}{2}$. (Once a sapling is turned into a perfectly-shaped apple tree, it will stay a perfectly-shaped apple tree.) The expected number of days it will take Emilia to obtain six perfectly-shaped apple trees is $\frac{m}{n}$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$. Find $100m+n$.
