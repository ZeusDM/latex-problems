In a rectangle $ABCD$, let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of sides $BC$ and $CD$, respectively, such that $AM$ is perpendicular to $MN$. Given that the length of $AN$ is $60$, the area of rectangle $ABCD$ is $m \sqrt{n}$ for positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $n$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Compute $100m+n$.
