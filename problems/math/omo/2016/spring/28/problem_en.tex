Let $N$ be the number of polynomials $P(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_{2016})$ of degree at most $2015$ with coefficients in the set $\{0, 1, 2 \}$ such that $P(a_1,a_2,\cdots ,a_{2016}) \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ for all $(a_1,a_2,\cdots ,a_{2016}) \in \{0, 1\}^{2016}.$

Compute the remainder when $v_3(N)$ is divided by $2011$, where $v_3(N)$ denotes the largest integer $k$ such that $3^k | N.$
