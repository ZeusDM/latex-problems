Jay is given a permutation $\{p_1, p_2,\ldots, p_8\}$ of $\{1, 2,\ldots, 8\}$. He may take two dividers and split the permutation into three non-empty sets, and he concatenates each set into a single integer. In other words, if Jay chooses $a,b$ with $1\le a< b< 8$, he will get the three integers $\overline{p_1p_2\ldots p_a}$, $\overline{p_{a+1}p_{a+2}\ldots p_{b}}$, and $\overline{p_{b+1}p_{b+2}\ldots p_8}$. Jay then sums the three integers into a sum $N=\overline{p_1p_2\ldots p_a}+\overline{p_{a+1}p_{a+2}\ldots p_b}+\overline{p_{b+1}p_{b+2}\ldots p_8}$. Find the smallest positive integer $M$ such that no matter what permutation Jay is given, he may choose two dividers such that $N\le M$.
