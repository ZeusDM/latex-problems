Yang the Spinning Square Sheep is a square in the plane such that his four legs are his four vertices. Yang can do two different types of \emph{tricks}:

\begin{enumerate}

Yang can choose one of his sides, then reflect himself over the side.
Yang can choose one of his legs, then rotate $90^\circ$ counterclockwise around the leg.

\end{enumerate}

Yang notices that after $2016$ tricks, each leg ends up in exactly the same place the leg started out in! Let there be $N$ ways for Yang to perform his $2016$ tricks. What is the remainder when $N$ is divided by $100000$?
