Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $BC=20$ and $CA=16$, and let $I$ be its incenter. If the altitude from $A$ to $BC$, the perpendicular bisector of $AC$, and the line through $I$ perpendicular to $AB$ intersect at a common point, then the length $AB$ can be written as $m+\sqrt{n}$ for positive integers $m$ and $n$. What is $100m+n$?
