In triangle $ABC$, $AB=3\sqrt{30}-\sqrt{10}$, $BC=12$, and $CA=3\sqrt{30}+\sqrt{10}$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $AB$ and $N$ be the midpoint of $AC$. Denote $l$ as the line passing through the circumcenter $O$ and orthocenter $H$ of $ABC$, and let $E$ and $F$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $B$ and $C$ to $l$, respectively. Let $l'$ be the reflection of $l$ in $BC$ such that $l'$ intersects lines $AE$ and $AF$ at $P$ and $Q$, respectively. Let lines $BP$ and $CQ$ intersect at $K$. $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are the reflections of $K$ over the perpendicular bisectors of sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively, and $R$ and $S$ are the midpoints of $XY$ and $XZ$, respectively. If lines $MR$ and $NS$ intersect at $T$, then the length of $OT$ can be expressed in the form $\frac{p}{q}$ for relatively prime positive integers $p$ and $q$. Find $100p+q$.
