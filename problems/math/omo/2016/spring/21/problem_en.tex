Say a real number $r$ is \emph{repetitive} if there exist two distinct complex numbers $z_1,z_2$ with $|z_1|=|z_2|=1$ and $\{z_1,z_2\}\neq\{-i,i\}$ such that 
\[
z_1(z_1^3+z_1^2+rz_1+1)=z_2(z_2^3+z_2^2+rz_2+1).
\]
There exist real numbers $a,b$ such that a real number $r$ is \emph{repetitive} if and only if $a < r\le b$. If the value of $|a|+|b|$ can be expressed in the form $\frac{p}{q}$ for relatively prime positive integers $p$ and $q$, find $100p+q$.
