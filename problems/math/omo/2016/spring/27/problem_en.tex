Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumradius $2$ and $\angle B-\angle C=15^\circ$. Denote its circumcenter as $O$, orthocenter as $H$, and centroid as $G$. Let the reflection of $H$ over $O$ be $L$, and let lines $AG$ and $AL$ intersect the circumcircle again at $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Define $B_1$ and $C_1$ as the points on the circumcircle of $ABC$ such that $BB_1\parallel AC$ and $CC_1\parallel AB$, and let lines $XY$ and $B_1C_1$ intersect at $Z$. Given that $OZ=2\sqrt 5$, then $AZ^2$ can be expressed in the form $m-\sqrt n$ for positive integers $m$ and $n$. Find $100m+n$.
