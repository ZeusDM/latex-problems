Let $ABCDEF$ be a regular hexagon of side length $3$. Let $X, Y,$ and $Z$ be points on segments $AB, CD,$ and $EF$ such that $AX=CY=EZ=1$. The area of triangle $XYZ$ can be expressed in the form $\dfrac{a\sqrt b}{c}$ where $a,b,c$ are positive integers such that $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime and $\gcd(a,c)=1$. Find $100a+10b+c$.
