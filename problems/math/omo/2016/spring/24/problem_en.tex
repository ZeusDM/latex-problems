Bessie and her $2015$ bovine buddies work at the Organic Milk Organization, for a total of $2016$ workers. They have a hierarchy of bosses, where obviously no cow is its own boss. In other words, for some pairs of employees $(A, B)$, $B$ is the boss of $A$. This relationship satisfies an obvious condition: if $B$ is the boss of $A$ and $C$ is the boss of $B$, then $C$ is also a boss of $A$. Business has been slow, so Bessie hires an outside organizational company to partition the company into some number of groups. To promote growth, every group is one of two forms. Either no one in the group is the boss of another in the group, or for every pair of cows in the group, one is the boss of the other. Let $G$ be the minimum number of groups needed in such a partition. Find the maximum value of $G$ over all possible company structures.
