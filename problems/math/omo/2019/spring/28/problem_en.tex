Let $ABC$ be a triangle. There exists a positive real number $x$ such that $AB=6x^2+1$ and $AC = 2x^2+2x$, and there exist points $W$ and $X$ on segment $AB$ along with points $Y$ and $Z$ on segment $AC$ such that $AW=x$, $WX=x+4$, $AY=x+1$, and $YZ=x$. For any line $\ell$ not intersecting segment $BC$, let $f(\ell)$ be the unique point $P$ on line $\ell$ and on the same side of $BC$ as $A$ such that $\ell$ is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle $PBC$. Suppose lines $f(WY)f(XY)$ and $f(WZ)f(XZ)$ meet at $B$, and that lines $f(WZ)f(WY)$ and $f(XY)f(XZ)$ meet at $C$. Then the product of all possible values for the length of $BC$ can be expressed in the form $a + \dfrac{b\sqrt{c}}{d}$ for positive integers $a,b,c,d$ with $c$ squarefree and $\gcd (b,d)=1$. Compute $100a+b+c+d$.
