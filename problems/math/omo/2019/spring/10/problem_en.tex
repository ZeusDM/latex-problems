When two distinct digits are randomly chosen in $N=123456789$ and their places are swapped, one gets a new number $N'$ (for example, if 2 and 4 are swapped, then $N'=143256789$). The expected value of $N'$ is equal to $\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute the remainder when $m+n$ is divided by $10^6$.
