Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $P(x)$ be a monic polynomial of degree $n$ with real coefficients. Also let $Q(x)=(x+1)^2(x+2)^2\dots (x+n+1)^2$. Consider the minimum possible value $m_n$ of $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \dfrac{i^2P(i^2)^2}{Q(i)}$. Then there exist positive constants $a,b,c$ such that, as $n$ approaches infinity, the ratio between $m_n$ and $a^{2n} n^{2n+b} c$ approaches $1$. Compute $\lfloor 2019 abc^2\rfloor$.
