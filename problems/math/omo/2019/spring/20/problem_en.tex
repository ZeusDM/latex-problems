Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=4$, $BC=5$, and $CA=6$. Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are points such that

\begin{itemize}
	  \item $BC$ and $XY$ are parallel
	  \item $BX$ and $CY$ intersect at a point $P$ on the circumcircle of $\triangle{ABC}$
	  \item the circumcircles of $\triangle{BCX}$ and $\triangle{BCY}$ are tangent to $AB$ and $AC$, respectively.
\end{itemize}

Then $AP^2$ can be written in the form $\frac{p}{q}$ for relatively prime positive integers $p$ and $q$. Compute $100p+q$.
