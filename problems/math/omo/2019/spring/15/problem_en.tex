Evan has $66000$ omons, particles that can cluster into groups of a perfect square number of omons. An omon in a cluster of $n^2$ omons has a potential energy of $\frac1n$. Evan accurately computes the sum of the potential energies of all the omons. Compute the smallest possible value of his result.
