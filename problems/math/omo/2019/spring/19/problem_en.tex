Arianna and Brianna play a game in which they alternate turns writing numbers on a paper. Before the game begins, a referee randomly selects an integer $N$ with $1 \leq N \leq 2019$, such that $i$ has probability $\frac{i}{1 + 2 + \dots + 2019}$ of being chosen. First, Arianna writes $1$ on the paper. On any move thereafter, the player whose turn it is writes $a+1$ or $2a$, where $a$ is any number on the paper, under the conditions that no number is ever written twice and any number written does not exceed $N$. No number is ever erased. The winner is the person who first writes the number $N$. Assuming both Arianna and Brianna play optimally, the probability that Brianna wins can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $m + n.$
