Jay is given $99$ stacks of blocks, such that the $i$th stack has $i^2$ blocks. Jay must choose a positive integer $N$ such that from each stack, he may take either $0$ blocks or exactly $N$ blocks. Compute the value Jay should choose for $N$ in order to maximize the number of blocks he may take from the $99$ stacks.
