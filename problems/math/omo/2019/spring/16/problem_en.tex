In triangle $ABC$, $BC=3, CA=4$, and $AB=5$. For any point $P$ in the same plane as $ABC$, define $f(P)$ as the sum of the distances from $P$ to lines $AB, BC$, and $CA$. The area of the locus of $P$ where $f(P)\leq 12$ is $\frac{m}{n}$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$. Compute $100m+n$.
