A set $D$ of positive integers is called \emph{indifferent} if there are at least two integers in the set, and for any two distinct elements $x,y\in D$, their positive difference $|x-y|$ is also in $D$. Let $M(x)$ be the smallest size of an indifferent set whose largest element is $x$. Compute the sum $M(2)+M(3)+\dots+M(100)$.
