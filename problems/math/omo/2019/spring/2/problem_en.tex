Let $A=(0,0), B=(1,0), C = (-1,0)$, and $D = (-1,1)$. Let $\mathcal C$ be the closed curve given by the segment $AB$, the minor arc of the circle $x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 2$ connecting $B$ to $C$, the segment $CD$, and the minor arc of the circle $x^2 + (y-1)^2=1$ connecting $D$ to $A$. Let $\mathcal D$ be a piece of paper whose boundary is $\mathcal C$. Compute the sum of all integers $2\le n\le 2019$ such that it is possible to cut $\mathcal D$ into $n$ congruent pieces of paper.
