Let $ABCD$ be an isosceles trapezoid with $\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}$. The incircle of $\triangle ABC$ has center $I$ and is tangent to $\overline{BC}$ at $P$. The incircle of $\triangle ABD$ has center $J$ and is tangent to $\overline{AD}$ at $Q$. If $PI = 8$, $IJ = 25$, and $JQ = 15$, compute the greatest integer less than or equal to the area of $ABCD$.
