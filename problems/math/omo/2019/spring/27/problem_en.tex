Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices $V_1,V_2,\dots, V_n$ and let $P_1,P_2, \dots, P_n$ be points in the plane. Suppose that, whenever $V_i$ and $V_j$ are connected by an edge, $P_iP_j$ has length $1$; in this situation, we say that the $P_i$ form an \emph{embedding} of $G$ in the plane. Consider a set $S\subseteq \{1,2,\dots, n\}$ and a configuration of points $Q_i$ for each $i\in S$. If the number of embeddings of $G$ such that $P_i=Q_i$ for each $i\in S$ is finite and nonzero, we say that $S$ is a \emph{tasty} set. Out of all tasty sets $S$, we define a function $f(G)$ to be the smallest size of a tasty set. Let $T$ be the set of all connected graphs on $n$ vertices with $n-1$ edges. Choosing $G$ uniformly and at random from $T$, let $a_n$ be the expected value of $\frac{f(G)^2}{n^2}$. Compute $\left\lfloor 2019 \displaystyle\lim_{n\to \infty} a_n \right\rfloor$.
