Let $S$ be the set of positive integers not divisible by $p^4$ for all primes $p$. Anastasia and Bananastasia play a game.

At the beginning, Anastasia writes down the positive integer $N$ on the board. Then the players take moves in turn; Bananastasia moves first. On any move of his, Bananastasia replaces the number $n$ on the blackboard with a number of the form $n-a$, where $a\in S$ is a positive integer. On any move of hers, Anastasia replaces the number $n$ on the blackboard with a number of the form $n^k$, where $k$ is a positive integer. Bananastasia wins if the number on the board becomes zero.

Compute the second-smallest possible value of $N$ for which Anastasia can prevent Bananastasia from winning.
