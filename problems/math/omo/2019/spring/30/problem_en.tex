Let $ABC$ be a triangle with symmedian point $K$, and let $\theta = \angle AKB-90^{\circ}$. Suppose that $\theta$ is both positive and less than $\angle C$. Consider a point $K'$ inside $\triangle ABC$ such that $A,K',K,$ and $B$ are concyclic and $\angle K'CB=\theta$. Consider another point $P$ inside $\triangle ABC$ such that $K'P\perp BC$ and $\angle PCA=\theta$. If $\sin \angle APB = \sin^2 (C-\theta)$ and the product of the lengths of the $A$- and $B$-medians of $\triangle ABC$ is $\sqrt{\sqrt{5}+1}$, then the maximum possible value of $5AB^2-CA^2-CB^2$ can be expressed in the form $m\sqrt{n}$ for positive integers $m,n$ with $n$ squarefree. Compute $100m+n$.
