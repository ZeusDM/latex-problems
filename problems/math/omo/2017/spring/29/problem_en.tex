Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=2\sqrt6, BC=5, CA=\sqrt{26}$, midpoint $M$ of $BC$, circumcircle $\Omega$, and orthocenter $H$. Let $BH$ intersect $AC$ at $E$ and $CH$ intersect $AB$ at $F$. Let $R$ be the midpoint of $EF$ and let $N$ be the midpoint of $AH$. Let $AR$ intersect the circumcircle of $AHM$ again at $L$. Let the circumcircle of $ANL$ intersect $\Omega$ and the circumcircle of $BNC$ at $J$ and $O$, respectively. Let circles $AHM$ and $JMO$ intersect again at $U$, and let $AU$ intersect the circumcircle of $AHC$ again at $V \neq A$. The square of the length of $CV$ can be expressed in the form $\dfrac mn$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$. Find $100m+n$.
