Kevin is trying to solve an economics question which has six steps. At each step, he has a probability $p$ of making a sign error. Let $q$ be the probability that Kevin makes an even number of sign errors (thus answering the question correctly!). For how many values of $0 \le p \le 1$ is it true that $p+q=1$?
