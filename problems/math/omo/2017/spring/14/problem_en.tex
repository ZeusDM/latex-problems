Let $ABC$ be a triangle, not right-angled, with positive integer angle measures (in degrees) and circumcenter $O$. Say that a triangle $ABC$ is \emph{good} if the following three conditions hold:

\begin{itemize}


\end{itemize}

Determine the number of ordered triples $(\angle A, \angle B,\angle C)$ for which $\triangle ABC$ is good.
