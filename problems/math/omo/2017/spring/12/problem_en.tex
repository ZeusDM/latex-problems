Alice has an isosceles triangle $M_0N_0P$, where $M_0P=N_0P$ and $\angle M_0PN_0=\alpha^{\circ}$. (The angle is measured in degrees.) Given a triangle $M_iN_jP$ for nonnegative integers $i$ and $j$, Alice may perform one of two \emph{elongations}:

\begin{itemize}


\end{itemize}

After a series of $5$ elongations, $k$ of which were $M$-elongations, Alice finds that triangle $M_kN_{5-k}P$ is an isosceles triangle. Given that $10\alpha$ is an integer, compute $10\alpha$.
