Lunasa, Merlin, and Lyrica each has an instrument. We know the following about the prices of their instruments:

\begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Given these conditions only, there exist integers $m$ and $n$ such that if we raise the price of Lunasa's violin by $m\%$ and decrease the price of Lyrica's piano by $m\%$, the violin must be exactly $\$n$ more expensive than the piano. Find $100m+n$.
