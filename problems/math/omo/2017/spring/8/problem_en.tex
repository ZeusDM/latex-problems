A five-digit positive integer is called $k$-\emph{phobic} if no matter how one chooses to alter at most four of the digits, the resulting number (after disregarding any leading zeroes) will not be a multiple of $k$. Find the smallest positive integer value of $k$ such that there exists a $k$-phobic number.
