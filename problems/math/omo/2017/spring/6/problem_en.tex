Let $ABCDEF$ be a regular hexagon with side length 10 inscribed in a circle $\omega$. $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are points on $\omega$ such that $X$ is on minor arc $AB$, $Y$ is on minor arc $CD$, and $Z$ is on minor arc $EF$, where $X$ may coincide with $A$ or $B$ (And similarly for $Y$ and $Z$). Compute the square of the smallest possible area of $XYZ$.
