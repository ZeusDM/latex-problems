For any positive integer $n$, let $S_n$ denote the set of positive integers which cannot be written in the form $an+2017b$ for nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$. Let $A_n$ denote the average of the elements of $S_n$ if the cardinality of $S_n$ is positive and finite, and $0$ otherwise. Compute \[\left\lfloor\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{A_n}{2^n}\right\rfloor.\]
