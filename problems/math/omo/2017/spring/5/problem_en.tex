There are $15$ (not necessarily distinct) integers chosen uniformly at random from the range from $0$ to $999$, inclusive. Yang then computes the sum of their units digits, while Michael computes the last three digits of their sum. The probability of them getting the same result is $\frac mn$ for relatively prime positive integers $m,n$. Find $100m+n$.
