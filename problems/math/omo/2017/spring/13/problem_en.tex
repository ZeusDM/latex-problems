On a real number line, the points $1, 2, 3, \dots, 11$ are marked. A grasshopper starts at point $1$, then jumps to each of the other $10$ marked points in some order so that no point is visited twice, before returning to point $1$. The maximal length that he could have jumped in total is $L$, and there are $N$ possible ways to achieve this maximum. Compute $L+N$.
