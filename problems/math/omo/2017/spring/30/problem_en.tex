Let $p = 2017$ be a prime. Given a positive integer $n$, let $T$ be the set of all $n\times n$ matrices with entries in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. A function $f:T\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is called an $n$-\emph{determinant} if for every pair $1\le i, j\le n$ with $i\not= j$, \[f(A) = f(A'),\] where $A'$ is the matrix obtained by adding the $j$th row to the $i$th row.

Let $a_n$ be the number of $n$-determinants. Over all $n\ge 1$, how many distinct remainders of $a_n$ are possible when divided by $\dfrac{(p^p - 1)(p^{p - 1} - 1)}{p - 1}$?
