Let $S$ denote the set of fractions $\dfrac mn$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$ with $m+n\le 10000$. The least fraction in $S$ that is strictly greater than \[\prod_{i=0}^\infty \left(1-\dfrac{1}{10^{2i+1}}\right)\] can be expressed in the form $\dfrac pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $1000p+q$.
