Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $BC=7,AB=5$, and $AC=8$. Let $M,N$ be the midpoints of sides $AC,AB$ respectively, and let $O$ be the circumcenter of $ABC$. Let $BO, CO$ meet $AC, AB$ at $P$ and $Q$, respectively. If $MN$ meets $PQ$ at $R$ and $OR$ meets $BC$ at $S$, then the value of $OS^2$ can be written in the form $\frac{m}{n}$ where $m,n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $100m+n$.
