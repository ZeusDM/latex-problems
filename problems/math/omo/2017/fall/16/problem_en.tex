Let $\mathcal{P}_1$ and $\mathcal{P}_2$ be two parabolas with distinct directrices $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ and distinct foci $F_1$ and $F_2$ respectively. It is known that $F_1F_2||\ell_1||\ell_2$, $F_1$ lies on $\mathcal{P}_2$, and $F_2$ lies on $\mathcal{P}_1$. The two parabolas intersect at distinct points $A$ and $B$. Given that $F_1F_2=1$, the value of $AB^2$ can be expressed as $\frac{m}{n}$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$. Find $100m+n$.
