For a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, let $P_G(x)$ be the unique polynomial of degree at most $n$ such that for each $i=0,1,2,\dots,n$, $P_G (i)$ equals the number of ways to color the vertices of the graph $G$ with $i$ distinct colors such that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color. For each integer $3\le k \le 2017$, define a $k$-\emph{tasty} graph to be a connected graph on $2017$ vertices with $2017$ edges and a cycle of length $k$. Let the \emph{tastiness} of a $k$-tasty graph $G$ be the number of coefficients in $P_G(x)$ that are odd integers, and let $t$ be the minimal tastiness over all $k$-tasty graphs with $3\le k \le 2017$. Determine the sum of all integers $b$ between $3$ and $2017$ inclusive for which there exists a $b$-tasty graph with tastiness $t$.
