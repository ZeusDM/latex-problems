The USAMO is a $6$ question test. For each question, you submit a positive integer number $p$ of pages on which your solution is written. On the $i$th page of this question, you write the fraction $i/p$ to denote that this is the $i$th page out of $p$ for this question. When you turned in your submissions for the $2017$ USAMO, the bored proctor computed the sum of the fractions for all of the pages which you turned in. Surprisingly, this number turned out to be $2017$. How many pages did you turn in?
