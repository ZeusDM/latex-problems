We define the bulldozer of triangle $ABC$ as the segment between points $P$ and $Q$, distinct points in the plane of $ABC$ such that $PA\cdot BC=PB\cdot CA=PC\cdot AB$ and $QA\cdot BC=QB\cdot CA=QC\cdot AB$. Let $XY$ be a segment of unit length in a plane $\mathcal{P}$, and let $\mathcal{S}$ be the region of $\mathcal P$ that the bulldozer of $XYZ$ sweeps through as $Z$ varies across the points in $\mathcal{P}$ satisfying $XZ=2YZ$. Find the greatest integer that is less than $100$ times the area of $\mathcal S$.
