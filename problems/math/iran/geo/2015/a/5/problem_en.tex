we have  a triangle $ ABC $ and make rectangles $ ABA_1B_2 $, $ BCB_1C_2 $ and $ CAC_1A_2 $ out of it.

then pass a line through $ A_2 $ perpendicular to $ C_1A_2 $ and pass another line through $ A_1 $ perpendicular to $  A_1B_2 $.

let $ A' $ the common point of this two lines.

like this we make $ B' $ and $ C' $.

prove $ AA' $, $ BB' $ and $ CC' $ intersect each other in a same point.
