Let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ be two circles such that $ \omega_1 \cap \omega_2 = \{ A,B\}$. Let $X$ be a point on $\omega_2$ and $Y$ be a point on $\omega_1$ such that $BY \bot BX$. Suppose that $O$ is the center of $\omega_1$ and $X' = \omega_2 \cap OX$.

If $ K = \omega_2 \cap X'Y$, prove that $ X $ is the midpoint of the arc $AK$.
