Three circles $\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3$ are tangent to line $l$ at points $A,B,C$ ($B$ lies between $A,C$) and $\omega_2$ is externally tangent to the other two. Let $X,Y$ be the intersection points of $\omega_2$ with the other common external tangent of $\omega_1,\omega_3$. The perpendicular line through $B$ to $l$ meets $\omega_2$ again at $Z$. Prove that the circle with diameter $AC$ touches $ZX,ZY$.
