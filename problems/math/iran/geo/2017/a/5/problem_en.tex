Sphere $S$ touches a plane. Let $A,B,C,D$ be four points on the plane such that no three of them are collinear. Consider the point $A'$ such that $S$ in tangent to the faces of tetrahedron $A'BCD$. Points $B',C',D'$ are defined similarly. Prove that $A',B',C',D'$ are coplanar and the plane $A'B'C'D'$ touches $S$.
