Let points $A, B$ and $C$ lie on the parabola $\Delta$ such that the point $H$,  orthocenter of triangle $ABC$,  coincides

with the focus of parabola $\Delta$. Prove that by changing the position of points $A, B$ and $C$ on $\Delta$ so that the orthocenter remain at $H$,  inradius of triangle $ABC$ remains unchanged.
