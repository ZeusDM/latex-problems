Given an acute non-isosceles triangle $ABC$ with circumcircle $\Gamma$. $M$ is the midpoint of segment $BC$ and $N$ is the midpoint of arc $BC$ of $\Gamma$ (the one that doesn't contain $A$).$X$ and $Y$ are points on $\Gamma$ such that $BX\parallel CY\parallel AM$. Assume there exists point $Z$ on segment $BC$ such that circumcircle of triangle $XYZ$ is tangent to $BC$. Let $\omega$ be the circumcircle of triangle $ZMN$. Line $AM$ meets $\omega$ for the second time at $P$. Let $K$ be a point on $\omega$ such that $KN\parallel AM$,  $\omega_b$ be a circle that passes through $B$,  $X$ and tangents to $BC$ and $\omega_c$ be a circle that passes through $C$,  $Y$ and tangents to $BC$. Prove that circle with center $K$ and radius $KP$ is tangent to 3 circles $\omega_b$,  $\omega_c$ and $\Gamma$.
