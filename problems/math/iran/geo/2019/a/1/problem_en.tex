Circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect each other at points $A$ and $B$. Point $C$ lies on the tangent line from $A$ to $\omega_1$ such that
$\angle ABC = 90^\circ$. Arbitrary line $\ell$ passes through $C$ and cuts $\omega_2$ at points $P$ and $Q$. Lines $AP$ and $AQ$ cut $\omega_1$ for the second time at points $X$ and $Z$ respectively. Let $Y$ be the foot of altitude from $A$ to $\ell$. Prove that points $X, Y$ and $Z$ are collinear.
