$ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. A circle passing through $A,B$ is tangent to segment $CD$ at point $E$. Another circle passing through $C,D$ is tangent to $AB$ at point $F$. Point $G$ is the intersection point of $AE,DF$,  and point $H$ is the intersection point of $BE,CF$. Prove that the incenters of triangles $AGF,BHF,CHE,DGE$ lie on a circle.
