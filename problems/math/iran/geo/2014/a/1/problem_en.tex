$ABC$ is a triangle with $\angle BAC=90^{\circ}$ and $\angle ACB=30^{\circ}$. Let $M_1$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Let $W$ be a circle passing through $A$ tangent in $M_1$ to $BC$. Let $P$ be the circumcircle of $ABC$. $W$ is intersecting $AC$ in $N$ and $P$ in $M$. Prove that $MN$ is perpendicular to $BC$.
