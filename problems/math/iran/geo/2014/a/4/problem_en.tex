A tangent line to circumcircle of acute triangle $ABC$ ($AC>AB$) at $A$ intersects with the extension of $BC$ at $P$. $O$ is the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$.Point $X$ lying on $OP$ such that $\measuredangle AXP=90^\circ$.Points $E$ and $F$ lying on $AB$ and $AC$, respectively,and they are in one side of line $OP$ such that $ \measuredangle EXP=\measuredangle ACX $  and $\measuredangle FXO=\measuredangle ABX $.$K$, $L$ are points of intersection $EF$ with circumcircle of triangle $ABC$.prove that $OP$ is tangent to circumcircle of triangle $KLX$.
