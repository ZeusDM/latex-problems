Two points $P$ and $Q$ lying on side $BC$ of  triangle $ABC$ and their distance from the midpoint of $BC$ are equal.The perpendiculars from $P$ and $Q$ to $BC$ intersect $AC$ and $AB$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively.$M$ is point of intersection $PF$ and $EQ$.If $H_1$ and $H_2$ be the orthocenters of triangles $BFP$ and $CEQ$,  respectively, prove that $ AM\perp H_1H_2 $.
