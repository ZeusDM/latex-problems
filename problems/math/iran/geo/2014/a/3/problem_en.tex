Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle.A circle with diameter $BC$ meets $AB$ and $AC$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively. $M$ is midpoint of $BC$ and $P$ is point of intersection $AM$ with $EF$. $X$ is an arbitary point on arc $EF$ and $Y$ is the second intersection of $XP$ with a circle with diameter $BC$.Prove that $ \measuredangle XAY=\measuredangle XYM $.
