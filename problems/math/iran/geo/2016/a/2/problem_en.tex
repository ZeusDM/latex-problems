In acute-angled triangle $ABC$,  altitude of $A$ meets $BC$ at $D$,  and $M$ is midpoint of $AC$. Suppose that $X$ is a point such that $\measuredangle AXB = \measuredangle DXM =90^\circ$ (assume that $X$ and $C$ lie on opposite sides of the line $BM$). Show that $\measuredangle XMB = 2\measuredangle MBC$.
