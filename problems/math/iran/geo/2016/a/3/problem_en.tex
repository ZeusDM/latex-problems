In a convex qualrilateral $ABCD$,  let $P$ be the intersection point of $AD$ and $BC$. Suppose that $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the incenters of triangles $PAB$ and $PDC$, respectively. Let $O$ be the circumcenter of $PAB$,  and $H$ the orthocenter of $PDC$. Show that the circumcircles of triangles $AI_1B$ and $DHC$ are tangent together if and only if the circumcircles of triangles $AOB$ and $DI_2C$ are tangent together.
