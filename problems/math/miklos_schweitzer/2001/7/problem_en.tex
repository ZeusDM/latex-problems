Let $e_1,\ldots, e_n$ be semilines on the plane starting from a common point. Prove that if there is no $u\not\equiv 0$ harmonic function on the whole plane that vanishes on the set $e_1\cup \cdots \cup e_n$, then there exists a pair $i,j$ of indices such that no $u\not\equiv 0$ harmonic function on the whole plane exists that vanishes on $e_i\cup e_j$.
