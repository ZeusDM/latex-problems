Let $H$ be the hyperbolic plane, $I(H)$ be the isometry group of $H$, and $O\in H$ be a fixed starting point. Determine those continuous $\sigma\colon H\rightarrow I(H)$ mappings that satisfty the following three conditions:
(a) $\sigma(O)=\mathrm{id}$, and $\sigma (X)O=X$ for all $X\in H$;
(b) for every $X\in H\backslash \{ O\}$ point, the $\sigma(X)$ isometry is a paracyclic shift, i.e. every member of a system of paracycles through a common infinitely far point is left invariant;
(c) for any pair $P,Q\in H$ of points there exists a point $X\in H$ such that $\sigma(X)P=Q$.
Prove that the $\sigma\colon H\rightarrow I(H)$ mappings satisfying the above conditions are differentiable with the exception of a point.
