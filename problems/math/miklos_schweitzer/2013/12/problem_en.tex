There are ${n}$ tokens in a pack. Some of them (at least one, but not all) are white and the rest are black. All tokens are extracted randomly from the pack, one by one, without putting them back. Let ${X_i}$ be the ratio of white tokens in the pack before the ${i^{\text{th}}}$ extraction and let
\[ \displaystyle T =\max \{ |X_i-X_j| : 1 \leq i \leq j \leq n\}.\]
Prove that ${\Bbb{E}(T) \leq H(\Bbb{E}(X_1))},$ where ${H(x)=-x\ln x -(1-x)\ln(1-x)}.$
