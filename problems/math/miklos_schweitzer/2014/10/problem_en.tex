To each vertex of a given triangulation of the two-dimensional sphere, we assign a convex subset of the plane. Assume that the three convex sets corresponding to the three vertices of any two-dimensional face of the triangulation have at least one point in common. Show that there exist four vertices such that the corresponding convex sets have at least one point in common.
