We have $4n + 5$ points on the plane, no three of them are collinear. The points are colored with two colors. Prove that from the points we can form $n$ empty triangles (they have no colored points in their interiors) with pairwise disjoint interiors, such that all points occurring as vertices of the $n$ triangles have the same color.
