Let $n\ge 1$  be a fixed integer. Calculate the distance $\inf_{p,f}\, \max_{0\le x\le 1} |f(x)-p(x)|$  , where $p$  runs over polynomials of degree less than $n$  with real coefficients and $f$  runs over functions $f(x)= \sum_{k=n}^{\infty} c_k x^k$   defined on the closed interval $[0,1]$ , where $c_k \ge 0$  and $\sum_{k=n}^{\infty} c_k=1$.
