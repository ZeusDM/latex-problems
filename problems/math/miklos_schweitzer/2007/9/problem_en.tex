Let $A$ and $B$ be two triangles on the plane such that the interior of both contains the origin and for each circle $C_r$ centered at the origin $|C_r \cap A|=|C_r\cap B|$ (where $|\cdot |$ is the arc-length measure). Prove that $A$ and $B$ are congruent. Does this statement remain true if the origin is on the border of $A$ or $B$?
