Suppose that the closed subset $K$ of the sphere
$$S^2=\{ (x,y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^3\colon x^2+y^2+z^2=1 \}$$is symmetric with respect to the origin and separates any two antipodal points in $S^2 \backslash K$. Prove that for any positive $\varepsilon$ there exists a homogeneous polynomial $P$ of odd degree such that the Hausdorff distance between
$$Z(P)=\{ (x,y,z)\in S^2 \colon P(x,y,z)=0\}$$and $K$ is less than $\varepsilon$.
