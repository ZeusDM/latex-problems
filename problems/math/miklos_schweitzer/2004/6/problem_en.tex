Is is true that if the perfect set $F\subseteq [0,1]$ is of zero Lebesgue measure then those functions in $C^1[0,1]$ which are one-to-one on $F$ form a dense subset of $C^1[0,1]$?
(We use the metric
$$d(f,g)=\sup_{x\in[0,1]} |f(x)-g(x)| + \sup_{x\in[0,1]} |f'(x)-g'(x)|$$to define the topology in the space $C^1[0,1]$ of continuously differentiable real functions on $[0,1]$.)
