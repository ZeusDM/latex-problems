We say that two sequences $x,y \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ are $\emph{completely different}$ if $x_n \neq y_n$ holds for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Let $F$ be a function assigning a natural number to every sequence of natural numbers such that $F(x)\neq F(y)$ for any pair of completely different sequences $x$, $y$, and for constant sequences we have $F \left((k,k,\dots)\right)=k$. Prove that there exists $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $F(x)=x_{n}$ for all sequences $x$.
