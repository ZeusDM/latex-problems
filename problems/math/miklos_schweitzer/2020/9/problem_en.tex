Let $D\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ be a compact set with at least two elements and consider the space $\Omega=\bigtimes_{i=1}^{\infty} D$ with the product topology. For any sequence $(d_n)_{n=0}^{\infty} \in \Omega$ let $f_{(d_n)}(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}d_nz^n$, and for each point $\zeta \in \mathbb{C}$ with $|\zeta|=1$ we define $S=S(\zeta,(d_n))$ to be the set of complex numbers $w$ for which there exists a sequence $(z_k)$ such that $|z_k|<1$, $z_k \to \zeta$, and $f_{d_n}(z_k) \to w$. Prove that on a residual set of $\Omega$, the set $S$ does not depend on the choice of $\zeta$.
