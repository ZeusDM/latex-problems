Consider horizontal and vertical segments in the plane that may intersect each other. Let $n$ denote their total number. Suppose that we have $m$ curves starting from the origin that are pairwise disjoint except for their endpoints. Assume that each curve intersects exactly two of the segments, a different pair for each curve. Prove that $m=O(n)$.
