An $n\times n$ matrix $A$ with integer  entries is called $\emph{representative}$ if, for any integer vector $\mathbf{v}$, there is a finite sequence $0=\mathbf{v}_0,\mathbf{v}_1,\dots,\mathbf{v}_\ell=\mathbf{v}$ of integer vectors such that for each $0\leq i <\ell$, either $\mathbf{v}_{i+1}=A\mathbf{v}_{i}$ or $\mathbf{v}_{i+1}-\mathbf{v}_i$ is an element of the standard basis (i.e. one of its entries is $1$, the rest are all equal to $0$). Show that $A$ is not representative if and only $A^T$ has a real eigenvector with all non-negative entries and non-negative eigenvalue.
