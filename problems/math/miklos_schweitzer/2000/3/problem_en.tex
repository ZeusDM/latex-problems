Prove that for every integer $n\ge 3$ there exists $N(n)$ with the following property: whenever $P$ is a set of at least $N(n)$ points of the plane such that any three points of $P$ determines a nondegenerate triangle containing at most one point of $P$ in its interior, then $P$ contains the vertices of a convex $n$-gon whose interior does not contain any point of $P$.
