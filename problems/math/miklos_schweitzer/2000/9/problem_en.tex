Let $M$ be a closed, orientable $3$-dimensional differentiable manifold, and let $G$ be a finite group of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of $M$. Let $P$ and $Q$ denote the set of those points of $M$ whose stabilizer is nontrivial (that is, contains a nonidentity element of $G$) and noncyclic, respectively. Let $\chi (P)$ denote the Euler characteristic of $P$. Prove that the order of $G$ divides $\chi (P)$, and $Q$ is the union of $-2\frac{\chi(P)}{|G|}$ orbits of $G$.
