Denote by $ H_n$ the linear space of $ n\times n$ self-adjoint complex matrices, and by $ P_n$ the cone of positive-semidefinite matrices in this space. Let us consider the usual inner product on $ H_n$
\[ \langle A,B\rangle = {\rm tr} AB\qquad (A,B\in H_n)\]
and its derived metric. Show that every $ \phi: P_n\to P_n$ isometry (that is a not necessarily surjective, distance preserving map with respect to the above metric) can be expressed as
\[ \phi(A) = UAU^* + X\qquad (A\in H_n)\]
or
\[ \phi(A) = UA^TU^* + X\qquad (A\in H_n)\]
where $ U$ is an $ n\times n$ unitary matrix, $ X$ is a positive-semidefinite matrix, and $ ^T$ and $ ^*$ denote taking the transpose and the adjoint, respectively.
