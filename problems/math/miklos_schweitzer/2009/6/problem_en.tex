A set system $ (S,L)$ is called a Steiner triple system, if  any pair  $ x\neq y$ of points lie on a unique line  and every line $ \ell\in L$ contains exactly three points. Let $ (S,L)$ be a Steiner triple system, and let us denote by $ xy$ the thrid point on a line determined by the points  Let $ A$ be a group whose factor by its center $ C(A)$ is of prime power order. Let $ f,h: S\to A$ be maps, such that $ C(A)$ contains the range of  and the range of $ h$ generates 
Show, that if
\[ f(x) = h(x)h(y)h(x)h(xy)\]
holds for all pairs $ x\neq y$ of points, then $ A$ is commutative, and there exists an element  such that $ f(x) = kh(x)$ for all
