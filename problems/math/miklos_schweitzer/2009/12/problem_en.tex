Let $ Z_1,\,Z_2\dots,\,Z_n$ be dimensional independent random (column) vectors with standard normal distribution,  Furthermore let
\[ \overline Z = \frac {1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n Z_i,\quad S_n = \frac {1}{n - 1}\sum_{i = 1}^n(Z_i - \overline Z)(Z_i - \overline Z)^\top\]
be the sample mean and corrected empirical covariance matrix. Consider the standardized samples   Show that
\[ \frac {E|Y_1 - Y_2|}{E|Z_1 - Z_2|} > 1,\]
and that the ratio does not depend on  only on
