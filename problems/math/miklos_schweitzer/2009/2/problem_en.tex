Let $ p_1,\dots,p_k$ be prime numbers, and let $ S$ be the set of those integers whose all prime divisors are among  For a finite subset $ A$ of the integers let us denote by $ \mathcal G(A)$ the graph whose vertices are the elements of  and the edges are those pairs $ a,b\in A$ for which  Does there exist for all $ m\geq 3$ an element subset $ A$ of the integers such that
(i) $ \mathcal G(A)$ is complete?
(ii) $ \mathcal G(A)$ is connected, but all vertices have degree at most 2?
