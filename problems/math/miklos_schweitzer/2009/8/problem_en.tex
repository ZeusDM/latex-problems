Let $ \{A_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of measurable subsets of the real line which covers almost every point infinitely often. Prove, that there exists a set $ B \subset \mathbb{N}$ of zero density, such that $ \{A_n\}_{n \in B}$ also covers almost every point infinitely often. (The set $ B \subset \mathbb{N}$ is of zero density if )
