Let $I$ and $J$ be intervals. Let $\varphi,\psi:I\to\mathbb{R}$ be strictly increasing continuous functions and let $\Phi,\Psi:J\to\mathbb{R}$ be continuous functions. Suppose that $\varphi(x)+\psi(x)=x$ and $\Phi(u)+\Psi(u)=u$ holds for all $x\in I$ and $u\in J$. Show that if $f:I\to J$ is a continuous solution of the functional inequality
$$f\big(\varphi(x)+\psi(y)\big)\le \Phi\big(f(x)\big)+\Psi\big(f(y)\big)\qquad (x,y\in I),$$then $\Phi\circ f\circ \varphi^{-1}$ and $\Psi\circ f\circ \psi^{-1}$ are convex functions.
