For a given $\alpha >0$ let us consider the regular, non-vanishing $f(z)$ maps on the unit disc $\{ |z|<1 \}$ for which $f(0)=1$ and $\mathrm{Re}\, z\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}>-\alpha$ ($|z|<1$). Show that the range of
$$g(z)=\frac{1}{(1-z)^{2\alpha}}$$contains the range of all other such functions. Here we consider that regular branch of $g(z)$ for which $g(0)=1$.
