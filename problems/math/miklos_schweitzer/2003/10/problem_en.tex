Let $X$ and $Y$ be independent random variables with "Saint-Petersburg" distribution, i.e. for any $k=1,2,\ldots$ their value is $2^k$ with probability $\frac{1}{2^k}$. Show that $X$ and $Y$ can be realized on a sufficiently big probability space such that there exists another pair of independent "Saint-Petersburg" random variables $(X', Y')$ on this space with the property that $X+Y=2X'+Y'I(Y'\le X')$ almost surely (here $I(A)$ denotes the indicator function of the event $A$).
