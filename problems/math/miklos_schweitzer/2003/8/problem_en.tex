Let $f_1, f_2, \ldots$ be continuous real functions on the real line. Is it true that if the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_n(x)$ is divergent for every $x$, then this holds also true for any typical choice of the signs in the sum (i.e. the set of those $\{ \epsilon _n\}_{n=1}^{\infty} \in \{ +1, -1\}^{\mathbb{N}}$ sequences, for which there series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \epsilon_nf_n(x)$ is convergent at least at one point $x$, forms a subset of first category within the set $\{+1,-1\}^{\mathbb{N}} $)?
