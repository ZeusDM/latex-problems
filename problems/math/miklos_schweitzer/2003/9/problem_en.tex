Given finitely many open half planes on the Euclidean plane. The boundary lines of these half planes divide the plane into convex domains. Find a polynomial $C(q)$ of degree two so that the following holds: for any $q\ge 1$ integer, if the half planes cover each point of the plane at least $q$ times, then the set of points covered exactly $q$ times is the union of at most $C(q)$ domains.
