We call an $n\times n$ matrix \textit{well groomed} if it only contains elements $0$ and $1$, and it does not contain the submatrix $\begin{pmatrix}
1& 0\\
 0 & 1
\end{pmatrix}.$ Show that there exists a constant $c>0$ such that every well groomed, $n\times n$ matrix contains a submatrix of size at least $cn\times cn$ such that all of the elements of  the submatrix are equal. (A well groomed matrix may contain the submatrix $\begin{pmatrix}
0& 1\\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.$ )
