We call an $m$-dimensional smooth manifold \textit{parallelizable} if it admits $m$ smooth tangent vector fields that are linearly independent at all points. Show that if $M$ is a closed orientable $2n$-dimensional smooth manifold of Euler characteristic $0$ that has an immersion into a parallelizable smooth $(2n+1)$-dimensional manifold $N$, then $M$ is itself parallelizable.
