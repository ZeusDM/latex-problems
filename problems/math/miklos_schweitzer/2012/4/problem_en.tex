Let $K$ be a convex shape in the $n$ dimensional space, having unit volume. Let $S \subset K$ be a Lebesgue measurable set with measure at least $1-\varepsilon$, where $0<\varepsilon<1/3$. Prove that dilating $K$ from its centroid by the ratio of $2\varepsilon \ln(1/\varepsilon)$, the shape obtained contains the centroid of $S$.
