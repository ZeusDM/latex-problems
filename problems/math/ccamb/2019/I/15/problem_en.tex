Before Harry Potter died, he decided to bury his wand in one of eight possible locations (uniformly at random). A squad of Death Eaters decided to go hunting for the wand. They know the eight locations but have poor vision, so even if they're at the correct location they only have a $50\%$ chance of seeing the wand. They also get tired easily, so they can only check three different locations a day. At least they have one thing going for them: they're clever. Assuming they strategize optimally, what is the expected number of days it will take for them to find the wand?
