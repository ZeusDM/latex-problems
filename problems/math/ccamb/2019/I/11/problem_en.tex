Let $G$ be the centroid of triangle $ABC$ with $AB=13,BC=14,CA=15$. Calculate the sum of the distances from $G$ to the three sides of the triangle.

Note: The \emph{centroid} of a triangle is the point that lies on each of the three line segments between a vertex and the midpoint of its opposite side.
