How many permutations $\pi$ of $\left\{1,2,\ldots,7\right\}$ are there such that $\pi\left(k\right)\leq2k$ for $k=1,\ldots,7$? A permutation $\pi$ of a set $S$ is a function from $S$ to itself such that if $a\neq b$, then $\pi\left(a\right)\neq\pi\left(b\right)$. For example, $\pi\left(x\right)=x$ and $\pi\left(x\right)=8-x$ are permutations of $\left\{1,2,\ldots,7\right\}$ but $\pi\left(x\right)=1$ is not.
