Call an odd prime $p$ \emph{adjective} if there exists an infinite sequence $a_0,a_1,a_2,\ldots$ of positive integers such that \[a_0\equiv1+\frac{1}{a_1}\equiv1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{a_2}}\equiv1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{a_3}}}\equiv\ldots\pmod p.\] What is the sum of the first three odd primes that are \emph{not} adjective?

Note: For two common fractions $\frac{a}{b}$ and $\frac{c}{d}$, we say that $\frac{a}{b}\equiv\frac{c}{d}\pmod p$ if $p$ divides $ad-bc$ and $p$ does not divide $bd$.
