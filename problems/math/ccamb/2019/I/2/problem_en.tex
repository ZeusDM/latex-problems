Square $1$ is drawn with side length $4$. Square $2$ is then drawn inside of Square $1$, with its vertices at the midpoints of the sides of Square $1$. Given Square $n$ for a positive integer $n$, we draw Square $n+1$ with vertices at the midpoints of the sides of Square $n$. For any positive integer $n$, we draw Circle $n$ through the four vertices of Square $n$. What is the area of Circle $7$?
