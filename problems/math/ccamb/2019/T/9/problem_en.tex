Points $P$, $Q$, and $M$ lie on a circle $\omega$ such that $M$ is the midpoint of minor arc $PQ$ and $MP=MQ=3$. Point $X$ varies on major arc $PQ$, $MX$ meets segment $PQ$ at $R$, the line through $R$ perpendicular to $MX$ meets minor arc $PQ$ at $S$, $MS$ meets line $PQ$ at $T$. If $TX=5$ when $MS$ is minimized, what is the minimum value of $MS$?
