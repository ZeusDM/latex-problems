For $i=1,2,\ldots,7$, Zadam Heng chooses a positive integer $m_i$ at random such that each positive integer $k$ is chosen with probability $\frac{2^i-1}{2^{ik}}$. If $m_1+2m_2+\ldots+7m_7\neq35$, Zadam keeps rechoosing the $m_i$ until this equality holds. Given that he eventually stops, what is the probability that $m_4=1$ when Zadam stops?
