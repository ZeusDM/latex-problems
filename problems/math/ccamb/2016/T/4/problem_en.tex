In the \emph{minesweeper} game below, each unopened square (for example, the one in the top left corner) is either empty or contains a mine. The other squares are empty and display the number of mines in the neighboring 8 squares (if this is 0, the square is unmarked). What is the minimum possible number of mines present on the field?
