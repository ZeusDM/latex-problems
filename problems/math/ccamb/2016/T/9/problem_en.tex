Let ABC be a triangle with $AB = 8$, $BC = 9$, and $CA = 10$. The line tangent to the circumcircle of $ABC$ at $A$ intersects the line $BC$ at $T$, and the circle centered at $T$ passing through $A$ intersects the line $AC$ for a second time at $S$. If the angle bisector of $\angle SBA$ intersects $SA$ at $P$, compute the length of segment $SP$.
