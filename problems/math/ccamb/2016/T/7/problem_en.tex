A \emph{cuboctahedron}, shown below, is a polyhedron with 8 equilateral triangle faces and 6 square faces. Each edge has the same length and each of the 24 vertices borders 2 squares and 2 triangles. An \emph{octahedron} is a regular polyhedron with 6 vertices and 8 equilateral triangle faces. Compute the sum of the volumes of an octahedron with side length 5 and a cuboctahedron with side length 5.
