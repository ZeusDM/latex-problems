Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients, leading coefficient 1, and $P(0) = 3$. If the polynomial $P(x)^2 + 1$ can be factored as a product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients, and the degree of $P$ is as small as possible, compute the largest possible value of $P(10)$.
