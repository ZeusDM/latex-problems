Let $P\left(X\right)=X^5+3X^4-4X^3-X^2-3X+4$. Determine the number of monic polynomials $Q\left(x\right)$ with integer coefficients such that $\frac{P\left(X\right)}{Q\left(X\right)}$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Note: a monic polynomial is one with leading coefficient $1$ (so $x^3-4x+5$ is one but not $5x^3-4x^2+1$ or $x^2+3x^3$).
