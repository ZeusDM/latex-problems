Amanda has the list of even numbers $2, 4, 6, \dots 100$ and Billy has the list of odd numbers $1, 3, 5, \dots 99$. Carlos creates a list by adding the square of each number in Amanda's list to the square of the corresponding number in Billy's list. Daisy creates a list by taking twice the product of corresponding numbers in Amanda's list and Billy's list. What is the positive difference between the sum of the numbers in Carlos's list and the sum of the numbers in Daisy's list?
