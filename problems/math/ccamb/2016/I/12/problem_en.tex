Let $f$ be a function from the set $X = \{1,2, \dots, 10\}$ to itself. Call a partition ($S$, $T$) of $X$ $f-balanced$ if for all $s \in S$ we have $f(s) \in T$ and for all $t \in T$ we have $f(t) \in S$. (A partition $(S, T)$ is a pair of subsets $S$ and $T$ of $X$ such that $S\cap T = \emptyset$ and $S \cup T = X$. Note that $(S, T)$ and $(T, S)$ are considered the same partition).
    
Let $g(f)$ be the number of $f-balanced$ partitions, and let $m$ equal the maximum value of $g$ over all functions $f$ from $X$ to itself. If there are $k$ functions satisfying $g(f) = m$, determine $m+k$.
