Triangle $ABC$ is a triangle with side lengths $13$, $14$, and $15$. A point $Q$ is chosen uniformly at random in the interior of $\triangle{ABC}$. Choose a random ray (of uniformly random direction) with endpoint $Q$ and let it intersect the perimeter of $\triangle{ABC}$ at $P$. What is the expected value of $QP^2$?
