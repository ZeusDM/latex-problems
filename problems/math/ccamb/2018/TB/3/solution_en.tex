Suppose that for a positive integer $n$, $5^{n+1}$ has the same number of digits as $5^n$. Let $5^n$ have $d$ digits and start with $s$. If $s\geq2$, then \[5^{n+1}\geq5\cdot s\cdot10^{d-1}\geq10^d,\] so $5^{n+1}$ has more digits than $5^n$, contradiction. Thus $5^n$ starts with $1$. Conversely, if $5^n$ starts with $1$, then $5^{n+1}$ starts with $5$ and has the same number of digits as $5^n$. Thus $5^n$ starts with $1$ if and only if $5^n$ and $5^{n+1}$ have the same number of digits.

Let $d\left(n\right)$ be the number of digits in $5^n$. Then $d\left(1\right)=1$, $d\left(2018\right)=1411$, and $d\left(n+1\right)-d\left(n\right)\in\left\{0,1\right\}$ for all positive integers $n$. We want to find the number of $n$ between $1$ and $2017$ inclusive such that $d\left(n+1\right)-d\left(n\right)=0$. Let this number be $N$. Then \[d\left(2018\right)-d\left(1\right)=\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{2017}d\left(n+1\right)-d\left(n\right)=N\cdot0+\left(2017-N\right)\cdot1=2017-N.\] Thus $N=\boxed{607}$ as desired.
