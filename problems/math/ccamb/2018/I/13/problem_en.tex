$P\left(x\right)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $6$ such that such that $P\left(1\right)$, $P\left(2\right)$, $P\left(3\right)$, $P\left(4\right)$, $P\left(5\right)$, $P\left(6\right)$, and $P\left(7\right)$ are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, and $7$ in some order. What is the maximum possible value of $P\left(8\right)$?
