In the land of Chaina, people pay each other in the form of links from chains. Fiona, originating from Chaina, has an open chain with $2018$ links. In order to pay for things, she decides to break up the chain by choosing a number of links and cutting them out one by one, each time creating $2$ or $3$ new chains. For example, if she cuts the $1111$th link out of her chain first, then she will have $3$ chains, of lengths $1110$, $1$, and $907$. What is the least number of links she needs to remove in order to be able to pay for anything costing from $1$ to $2018$ links using some combination of her chains?
