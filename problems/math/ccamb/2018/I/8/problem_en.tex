The New York Times Mini Crossword is a $5\times5$ grid with the top left and bottom right corners shaded. Each row and column has a clue given (so that there are $10$ clues total). Jeffrey has a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of knowing the answer to each clue. What is the probability that he can fill in every unshaded square in the crossword?
