In the game of Avalon, there are $10$ players, $4$ of which are bad. A \emph{quest} is a subset of those players. A quest fails if it contains at least one bad player. A randomly chosen quest of $3$ players happens to fail. What is the probability that there is exactly one bad player in the failed quest?
