Mr. Vader gave out a multiple choice test, and every question had an answer that was one of A, B, or C. After the test, he curved the test so that everybody got +50 (so a person who got $x\%$ right would get a score of $x+50$). In the class, a score in the range $\left[90,\infty\right)$ gets an A, a score in the range $\left[80,90\right)$ gets a B, and a score in the range $\left[70,80\right)$ gets a C. After the curve, Mr. Vader makes this statement: ``Guess A, get an A. Guess B, get a B. Guess C, get a C.'' That is, answering every question with the answer choice X would give, with the curve, a score receiving a grade of X, where X is one of A, B, C. Luke, a student in Mr. Vader's class, was told ahead of time that there were either $5$ or $6$ answers as A on the test. Find the sum of all possible values of the number of questions on the test, given this information.
