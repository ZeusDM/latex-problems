The $12$ islands of the Bonanza archipelago are labeled $A,B,C,\dots,K,L$. Some of the islands are connected by bridges, as indicated in the diagram below. Tristan wants be able to walk from island to island crossing each bridge exactly once (he doesn't care if he visits a given island more than once, or whether he starts and ends on the same island). Submit a pair of unconnected islands such that if they are connected by a bridge, Tristan can accomplish his goal.
