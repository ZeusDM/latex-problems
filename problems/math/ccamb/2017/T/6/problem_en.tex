Alice and Bob take $a$ and $b$ candies respectively, where $0\leq a,b\leq3$, from a pile of $6$ identical candies. They draw the candies one at a time, but one person may draw multiple candies in a row. For example, if $a=2$ and $b=3$, a possible order of drawing could be Alice, Bob, Bob, Alice, Bob. In how many ways (considering order of drawing and values of $a$ and $b$) can this happen?
