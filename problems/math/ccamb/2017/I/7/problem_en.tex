Ari the Archer is shooting at an abnormal target. The target consists of $100$ concentric rings, each of width $1$, so that the total radius of the target is $100$. The point value of a given ring of the target is equal to its area (so getting a bull's eye would be worth $\pi$ points, but hitting on the outer ring would give $199\pi$ points). Given that Ari hits any point on the target uniformly at random, what is his expected score?
