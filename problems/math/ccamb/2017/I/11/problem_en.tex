$480$ $1$ cm unit cubes are used to build a block measuring $6$ cm by $8$ cm by $10$ cm. A tiny ant then chews his way in a straight line from one vertex of the block to the furthest vertex. How many cubes does the ant pass through? The ant is so tiny that he does not "pass through" cubes if he is merely passing through where their edges or vertices meet.
