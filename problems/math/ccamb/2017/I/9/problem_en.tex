Magic Mark performs a magic trick using a standard $52$-card deck except the suits are erased from cards (so that there are $4$ identical cards of each rank). He randomly takes $13$ cards and uses those to perform his trick. He lets you randomly pick a card from those $13$, memorize it, and put it back in the pile of $13$ cards. He then shuffles the $13$ and takes out a card randomly. If he picks a card identical to yours, the trick is successful. What is probability that the trick is successful?
