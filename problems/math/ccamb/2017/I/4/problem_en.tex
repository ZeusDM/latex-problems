Cole is trying to solve the \emph{Collatz conjecture}. She decides to make a model with a piece of wood with a hole for every natural number. For every even number there is a rope from $n$ to $\frac{n}{2}$ and for every odd number there is a rope from $n$ to $3n+1$. She wants to bring her model to a convention but in order to do that she needs to cut off the part containing the first $240$ holes. How many ropes did she break?
