In the [i]magic square[/i] below, every integer from $1$ to $25$ can be filled in such that the sum in every row, column, and long diagonal is the same. Given that the number in the center square is $18$, what is the sum of the entries in the shaded squares?

\begin{center}
\begin{asy}
size(4cm);
for (int i = 0; i <= 5; ++i) {
draw((0,i)--(5,i));
}

for (int i = 0; i <= 5; ++i) {
draw((i,0)--(i,5));
}

for (int i = 0; i <= 4; ++i) {
for (int j = 0; j <= 4; ++j) {
if ((i+j)%6 == 1 || (i-j)%6 == 3) {
fill((i,j)--(i+1,j)--(i+1,j+1)--(i,j+1)--cycle, gray);
}
}
}
label("\Large{18}", (2.5,2.5));
\end{asy}
\end{center}
