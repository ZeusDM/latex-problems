We are given triangles $ABC$ and $DEF$ such that $D\in BC, E\in CA, F\in AB$, $AD\perp EF, BE\perp FD, CF\perp DE$.  Let the circumcenter of $DEF$ be $O$, and let the circumcircle of $DEF$ intersect $BC,CA,AB$ again at $R,S,T$ respectively. Prove that the perpendiculars to $BC,CA,AB$ through $D,E,F$ respectively intersect at a point $X$, and the lines $AR,BS,CT$ intersect at a point $Y$, such that $O,X,Y$ are collinear.
