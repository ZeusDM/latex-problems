In triangle $ABC$ with incenter $I$ and circumcenter $O$, let $A',B',C'$ be the points of tangency of its circumcircle with its $A,B,C$-mixtilinear circles, respectively.  Let $\omega_A$ be the circle through $A'$ that is tangent to $AI$ at $I$, and define $\omega_B, \omega_C$ similarly. Prove that $\omega_A,\omega_B,\omega_C$ have a common point $X$ other than $I$, and that $\angle AXO = \angle OXA'$.
