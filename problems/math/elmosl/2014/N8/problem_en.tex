Let $\mathbb N$ denote the set of positive integers. Find all functions $f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that:
(i) The greatest common divisor of the sequence $f(1), f(2), \dots$ is $1$.
(ii) For all sufficiently large integers $n$, we have $f(n) \neq 1$ and  \[ f(a)^n \mid f(a+b)^{a^{n-1}} - f(b)^{a^{n-1}} \]  for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.
