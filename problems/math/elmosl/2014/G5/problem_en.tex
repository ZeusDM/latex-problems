Let $P$ be a point in the interior of an acute triangle $ABC$, and let $Q$ be its isogonal conjugate.  Denote by $\omega_P$ and $\omega_Q$ the circumcircles of triangles $BPC$ and $BQC$, respectively.  Suppose the circle with diameter $\overline{AP}$ intersects $\omega_P$ again at $M$, and line $AM$ intersects $\omega_P$ again at $X$.  Similarly, suppose the circle with diameter $\overline{AQ}$ intersects $\omega_Q$ again at $N$, and line $AN$ intersects $\omega_Q$ again at $Y$.

Prove that lines $MN$ and $XY$ are parallel.

(Here, the points $P$ and $Q$ are \textit{isogonal conjugates} with respect to $\triangle ABC$ if the internal angle bisectors of $\angle BAC$, $\angle CBA$, and $\angle ACB$ also bisect the angles $\angle PAQ$, $\angle PBQ$, and $\angle PCQ$, respectively.  For example, the orthocenter is the isogonal conjugate of the circumcenter.)
