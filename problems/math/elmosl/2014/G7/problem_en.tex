Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcenter $O$. Let $P$ be a point inside $ABC$, so let the points $D, E, F$ be on $BC, AC, AB$ respectively so that the Miquel point of $DEF$ with respect to $ABC$ is $P$. Let the reflections of $D, E, F$ over the midpoints of the sides that they lie on be $R, S, T$. Let the Miquel point of $RST$ with respect to the triangle $ABC$ be $Q$. Show that $OP = OQ$.
