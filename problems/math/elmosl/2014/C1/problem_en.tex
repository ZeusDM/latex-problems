You have some cyan, magenta, and yellow beads on a non-reorientable circle, and you can perform only the following operations:
1. Move a cyan bead right (clockwise) past a yellow bead, and turn the yellow bead magenta.
2. Move a magenta bead left of a cyan bead, and insert a yellow bead left of where the magenta bead ends up.
3. Do either of the above, switching the roles of the words ``magenta'' and ``left'' with those of ``yellow'' and ``right'', respectively.
4. Pick any two disjoint consecutive pairs of beads, each either yellow-magenta or magenta-yellow, appearing somewhere in the circle, and swap the orders of each pair.
5. Remove four consecutive beads of one color.


Starting with the circle: ``yellow, yellow, magenta, magenta, cyan, cyan, cyan'', determine whether or not you can reach
a) ``yellow, magenta, yellow, magenta, cyan, cyan, cyan'',
b) ``cyan, yellow, cyan, magenta, cyan'',
c) ``magenta, magenta, cyan, cyan, cyan'',
d) ``yellow, cyan, cyan, cyan''.
