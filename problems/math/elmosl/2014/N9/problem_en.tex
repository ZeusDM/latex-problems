Let $d$ be a positive integer and let $\varepsilon$ be any positive real. Prove that for all sufficiently large primes $p$ with $\gcd(p-1,d) \neq 1$, there exists an positive integer less than $p^r$ which is not a $d$th power modulo $p$, where $r$ is defined by \[ \log r = \varepsilon - \frac{1}{\gcd(d,p-1)}. \]
