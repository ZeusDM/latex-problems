Given a permutation of $1,2,3,\dots,n$, with consecutive elements $a,b,c$ (in that order), we may perform either of the \textit{moves}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If $a$ is the median of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we may replace $a,b,c$ with $b,c,a$ (in that order)
	\item If $c$ is the median of $a$, $b$, and $c$, we may replace $a,b,c$ with $c,a,b$ (in that order)
\end{itemize}
What is the least number of sets in a partition of all $n!$ permutations, such that any two permutations in the same set are obtainable from each other by a sequence of moves?
