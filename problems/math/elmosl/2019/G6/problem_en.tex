Let $ABC$ be an acute scalene triangle and let $P$ be a point in the plane. For any point $Q\neq A,B,C$, define $T_A$ to be the unique point such that $\triangle T_ABP \sim \triangle T_AQC$ and $\triangle T_ABP, \triangle T_AQC$ are oriented in the same direction (clockwise or counterclockwise). Similarly define $T_B, T_C$.

a) Find all $P$ such that there exists a point $Q$ with $T_A,T_B,T_C$ all lying on the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$. Call such a pair $(P,Q)$ a \textit{tasty pair} with respect to $\triangle ABC$.

b) Keeping the notations from a), determine if there exists a tasty pair which is also tasty with respect to $\triangle T_AT_BT_C$.
