Let $\triangle ABC$ be an acute triangle with incenter $I$ and circumcenter $O$. The incircle touches sides $BC,CA,$ and $AB$ at $D,E,$ and $F$ respectively, and $A'$ is the reflection of $A$ over $O$. The circumcircles of $ABC$ and $A'EF$ meet at $G$, and the circumcircles of $AMG$ and $A'EF$ meet at a point $H\neq G$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $EF$. Prove that if $GH$ and $EF$ meet at $T$, then $DT\perp EF$.
