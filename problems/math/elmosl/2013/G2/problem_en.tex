Let $ABC$ be a scalene triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$, and let $D$,$E$,$F$ be the points where its incircle meets $BC$, $AC$, $AB$ respectively. Let the circumcircles of $\triangle AEF$, $\triangle BFD$, and $\triangle CDE$ meet $\Gamma$ a second time at $X,Y,Z$ respectively. Prove that the perpendiculars from $A,B,C$ to $AX,BY,CZ$ respectively are concurrent.
