In $\triangle ABC$, a point $D$ lies on line $BC$.  The circumcircle of $ABD$ meets $AC$ at $F$ (other than $A$), and the circumcircle of $ADC$ meets $AB$ at $E$ (other than $A$).  Prove that as $D$ varies, the circumcircle of $AEF$ always passes through a fixed point other than $A$, and that this point lies on the median from $A$ to $BC$.
