Triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in circle $\omega$.  A circle with chord $BC$ intersects segments $AB$ and $AC$ again at $S$ and $R$, respectively.  Segments $BR$ and $CS$ meet at $L$, and rays $LR$ and $LS$ intersect $\omega$ at $D$ and $E$, respectively.  The internal angle bisector of $\angle BDE$ meets line $ER$ at $K$.  Prove that if $BE = BR$, then $\angle ELK = \tfrac{1}{2} \angle BCD$.
