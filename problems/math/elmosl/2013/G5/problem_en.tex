Let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ be two orthogonal circles, and let the center of $\omega_1$ be $O$. Diameter $AB$ of $\omega_1$ is selected so that $B$ lies strictly inside $\omega_2$.  The two circles tangent to $\omega_2$, passing through $O$ and $A$, touch $\omega_2$ at $F$ and $G$. Prove that $FGOB$ is cyclic.
