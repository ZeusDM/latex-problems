Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and let $D$, $A$, $B$, $E$ be points on line $AB$, in that order, such that $AC=AD$ and $BE=BC$. Let $\omega_1, \omega_2$ be the circumcircles of $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle CDE$, respectively, which meet at a point $F \neq C$.  If the tangent to $\omega_2$ at $F$ cuts $\omega_1$ again at $G$, and the foot of the altitude from $G$ to $FC$ is $H$, prove that $\angle AGH=\angle BGH$.
