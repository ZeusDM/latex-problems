In $\triangle ABC$, $AB<AC$. $D$ and $P$ are the feet of the internal and external angle bisectors of $\angle BAC$, respectively. $M$ is the midpoint of segment $BC$, and $\omega$ is the circumcircle of $\triangle APD$. Suppose $Q$ is on the minor arc $AD$ of $\omega$ such that $MQ$ is tangent to $\omega$. $QB$ meets $\omega$ again at $R$, and the line through $R$ perpendicular to $BC$ meets $PQ$ at $S$.  Prove $SD$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $\triangle QDM$.
