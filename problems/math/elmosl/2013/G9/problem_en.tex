Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral inscribed in circle $\omega$ whose diagonals meet at $F$.  Lines $AB$ and $CD$ meet at $E$.  Segment $EF$ intersects $\omega$ at $X$.  Lines $BX$ and $CD$ meet at $M$, and lines $CX$ and $AB$ meet at $N$.  Prove that $MN$ and $BC$ concur with the tangent to $\omega$ at $X$.
