Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with incenter $I$ and circumcircle $\omega$. Suppose a circle $\omega_B$ is tangent to $BA,BC$, and internally tangent to $\omega$ at $B_1$, while a circle $\omega_C$ is tangent to $CA, CB$, and internally tangent to $\omega$ at $C_1$. If $B_2, C_2$ are the points opposite to $B,C$ on $\omega$, respectively, and $X$ denotes the intersection of $B_1C_2, B_2C_1$, prove that $XA=XI$.
