Let $ABC$ be a triangle with orthocenter $H,$ and let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{BC}.$ Suppose that $P$ and $Q$ are distinct points on the circle with diameter $\overline{AH},$ different from $A,$ such that $M$ lies on line $PQ.$ Prove that the orthocenter of $\triangle APQ$ lies on the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC.$
