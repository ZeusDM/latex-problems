Let $ABC$ be a scalene triangle with $\angle A = 60^{\circ}$. Let $E$ and $F$ be the feet of the angle bisectors of $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ACB$, respectively, and let $I$ be the incenter of $\triangle ABC$. Let $P,Q$ be distinct points such that $\triangle PEF$ and $\triangle QEF$ are equilateral. If $O$ is the circumcenter of of $\triangle APQ$, show that $\overline{OI}\perp \overline{BC}$.
