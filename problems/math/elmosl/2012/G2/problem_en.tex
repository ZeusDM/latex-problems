In triangle $ABC$, $P$ is a point on altitude $AD$. $Q,R$ are the feet of the perpendiculars from $P$ to $AB,AC$, and $QP,RP$ meet $BC$ at $S$ and $T$ respectively. the circumcircles of $BQS$ and $CRT$ meet $QR$ at $X,Y$.

a) Prove $SX,TY, AD$ are concurrent at a point $Z$.

b) Prove $Z$ is on $QR$ iff $Z=H$, where $H$ is the orthocenter of $ABC$.
