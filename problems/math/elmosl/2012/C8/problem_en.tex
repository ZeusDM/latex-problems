Consider the equilateral triangular lattice in the complex plane defined by the Eisenstein integers; let the ordered pair $(x,y)$ denote the complex number $x+y\omega$ for $\omega=e^{2\pi i/3}$. We define an $\omega$-chessboard polygon to be a (non self-intersecting) polygon whose sides are situated along lines of the form $x=a$ or $y=b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. These lines divide the interior into unit triangles, which are shaded alternately black and white so that adjacent triangles have different colors. To tile an $\omega$-chessboard polygon by lozenges is to exactly cover the polygon by non-overlapping rhombuses consisting of two bordering triangles. Finally, a \textit{tasteful tiling} is one such that for every unit hexagon tiled by three lozenges, each lozenge has a black triangle on its left (defined by clockwise orientation) and a white triangle on its right (so the lozenges are BW, BW, BW in clockwise order).

a) Prove that if an $\omega$-chessboard polygon can be tiled by lozenges, then it can be done so tastefully.

b) Prove that such a tasteful tiling is unique.
