Circles $\Omega$ and $\omega$ are internally tangent at point $C$. Chord $AB$ of $\Omega$ is tangent to $\omega$ at $E$, where $E$ is the midpoint of $AB$. Another circle, $\omega_1$ is tangent to $\Omega, \omega,$ and $AB$ at $D,Z,$ and $F$ respectively. Rays $CD$ and $AB$ meet at $P$. If $M$ is the midpoint of major arc $AB$, show that $\tan \angle ZEP = \tfrac{PE}{CM}$.
