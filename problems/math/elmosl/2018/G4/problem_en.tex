Let $ABCDEF$ be a hexagon inscribed in a circle $\Omega$ such that triangles $ACE$ and $BDF$ have the same orthocenter. Suppose that segments $BD$ and $DF$ intersect $CE$ at $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Show that there is a point common to $\Omega$, the circumcircle of $DXY$, and the line through $A$ perpendicular to $CE$.
