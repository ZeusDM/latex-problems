Hamster is playing a game on an $m \times n$ chessboard. He places a rook anywhere on the board and then moves it around with the restriction that every vertical move must be followed by a horizontal move and every horizontal move must be followed by a vertical move. For what values of $m,n$ is it possible for the rook to visit every square of the chessboard exactly once? A square is only considered visited if the rook was initially placed there or if it ended one of its moves on it.
