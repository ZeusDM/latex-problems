Let $n > 1$ be a positive integer. A 2-dimensional grid, infinite in all directions, is given. Each 1 by 1 square in a given $n$ by $n$ square has a counter on it. A \textit{move} consists of taking $n$ adjacent counters in a row or column and sliding them each by one space along that row or column. A \textit{returning sequence} is a finite sequence of moves such that all counters again fill the original $n$ by $n$ square at the end of the sequence.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assume that all counters are distinguishable except two, which are indistinguishable from each other. Prove that any distinguishable arrangement of counters in the $n$ by $n$ square can be reached by a returning sequence.
	\item Assume all counters are distinguishable. Prove that there is no returning sequence that switches two counters and returns the rest to their original positions.
\end{itemize}
