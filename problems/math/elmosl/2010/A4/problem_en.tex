Let $-2 < x_1 < 2$ be a real number and define $x_2, x_3, \ldots$ by $x_{n+1} = x_n^2-2$ for $n \geq 1$. Assume that no $x_n$ is $0$ and define a number $A$, $0 \leq A \leq 1$ in the following way: The $n^{\text{th}}$ digit after the decimal point in the binary representation of $A$ is a $0$ if $x_1x_2\cdots x_n$ is positive and $1$ otherwise. Prove that $A = \frac{1}{\pi}\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{x_1}{2}\right)$.
