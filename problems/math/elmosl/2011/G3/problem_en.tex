Let $ABC$ be a triangle. Draw circles $\omega_A$, $\omega_B$, and $\omega_C$ such that $\omega_A$ is tangent to $AB$ and $AC$, and $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ are defined similarly. Let $P_A$ be the insimilicenter of $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$. Define $P_B$ and $P_C$ similarly. Prove that $AP_A$, $BP_B$, and $CP_C$ are concurrent.
