Each of the thieves in the $n$-member party ($n \ge 3$) charged a certain number of coins. All the coins were $100n$. Thieves decided to share their prey as follows: at each step, one of the bandits puts one coin to the other two. Find them all natural numbers $n \ge 3$ for which after a finite number of steps each outlaw can have $100$ coins no matter how many coins each thug has charged.
