On the board is written in decimal the integer positive number $N$. If it is not a single digit number, wipe its last digit $c$ and replace the number $m$ that remains on the board with a number $m -3c$. (For example, if $N = 1,204$ on the board, $120 - 3 \cdot  4 = 108$.) Find all the natural numbers $N$, by repeating the adjustment described eventually we get the number $0$.
