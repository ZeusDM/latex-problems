Rumburak kidnapped $31$ members of party $A$ , $28$ members of party $B$, $23$ members of party $C$, $19$ members of Party $D$ and each of them in a separate cell. After work out occasionally they could walk in the yard and talk. Once three people started to talk to each other members of three different parties, Rumburak re-registered them to the fourth party as a punishment.(They never talked to each other more than three kidnapped.)
a) Could it be that after some time all were abducted by members of one party? Which?
b) Determine all four positive integers of which the sum is $101$ and which as the numbers of kidnapped members of the four parties allow the Rumburaks all of them became members of one party over time.
