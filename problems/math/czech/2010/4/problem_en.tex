A circle $k$ is given with a non-diameter chord $AC$.  On the tangent at point $A$ select point $X \ne A$ and mark $D$ the intersection of the circle $k$ with the interior of the line $XC$ (if any). Let $B$ a point in circle $k$ such that quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a trapezoid . Determine the set of intersections of lines $BC$ and $AD$ belonging to all such trapezoids.
