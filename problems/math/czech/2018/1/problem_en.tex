In a group of people, there are some mutually friendly pairs. For positive integer $k\ge3$ we say the group is $k$-great, if every (unordered) $k$-tuple of people from the group can be seated around a round table it the way that all pairs of neighbors are mutually friendly. \textit{(Since this was the 67th year of CZE/SVK MO,)} show that if the group is 6-great, then it is 7-great as well.
\textit{Bonus} (not included in the competition): Determine all positive integers $k\ge3$ for which, if the group is $k$-great, then it is  $(k+1)$-great as well.
