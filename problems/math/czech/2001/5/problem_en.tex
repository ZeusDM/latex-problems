A sheet of paper has the shape of an isosceles trapezoid $C_1AB_2C_2$ with the shorter base $B_2C_2$. The foot of the perpendicular from the midpoint $D$ of $C_1C_2$ to $AC_1$ is denoted by $B_1$. Suppose that upon folding the paper along $DB_1, AD$ and $AC_1$ points $C_1,C_2$ become a single point $C$ and points $B_1,B_2$ become a point $B$. The area of the tetrahedron $ABCD$ is $64$ cm$^2$ . Find the sides of the initial trapezoid.
