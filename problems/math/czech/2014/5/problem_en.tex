Given is the acute triangle $ABC$. Let us denote $k$ a circle with diameter $AB$. Another circle, tangent to $AB$ at point $A$ and passing through point $C$ intersects the circle $k$ at point $P, P \ne A$. Another  circle which touches AB at point $B$ and passes point $C$, intersects the circle $k$ at point $Q, Q \ne B$. Prove that the intersection of the line $AQ$ and $BP$ lies on one of the sides of angle $ACB$.
