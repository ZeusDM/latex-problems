A positive integer $n$ is called \textit{good} if and only if there exist exactly $4$ positive integers $k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4$ such that $n+k_i|n+k_i^2$ ($1 \leq k \leq 4$). Prove that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $58$ is \textit{good};

	\item $2p$ is \textit{good} if and only if $p$ and $2p+1$ are both primes ($p>2$).
\end{itemize}
