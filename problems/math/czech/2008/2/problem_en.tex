At one moment, a kid noticed that the end of the hour hand, the end of the minute hand and one of the twelve numbers (regarded as a point) of his watch formed an equilateral triangle. He also calculated that $t$ hours would elapse for the next similar case. Suppose that the ratio of the lengths of the minute hand (whose length is equal to the distance from the center of the watch plate to any of the twelve numbers) and the hour hand is $k>1$. Find the maximal value of $t$.
