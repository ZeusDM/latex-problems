Let be $ABC$ an acute-angled triangle. Consider point $P$ lying on the opposite ray to the ray $BC$ such that $|AB|=|BP|$. Similarly, consider point $Q$ on the opposite ray to the ray $CB$ such that $|AC|=|CQ|$. Denote $J$ the excenter of $ABC$ with respect to $A$ and $D,E$ tangent points of this excircle with the lines $AB$ and $AC$, respectively. Suppose that the opposite rays to $DP$ and $EQ$ intersect in $F\neq J$. Prove that $AF\perp FJ$.
