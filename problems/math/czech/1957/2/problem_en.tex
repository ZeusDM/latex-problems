Consider a (right) square pyramid $ABCDV$ with the apex $V$ and the base (square) $ABCD$. Denote $d=AB/2$ and $\varphi$ the dihedral angle between planes $VAD$ and $ABC$.
(1) Consider a line $XY$ connecting the skew lines $VA$ and $BC$, where $X$ lies on line $VA$ and $Y$ lies on line $BC$. Describe a construction of line $XY$ such that the segment $XY$ is of the smallest possible length. Compute the length of segment $XY$ in terms of $d,\varphi$.
(2) Compute the distance $v$ between points $V$ and $X$ in terms of $d,\varphi.$
