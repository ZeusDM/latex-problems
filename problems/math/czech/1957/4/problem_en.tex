Consider a non-zero convex angle $\angle POQ$ and its inner point $M$. Moreover, let $m>0$ be given. Construct a trapezoid $ABCD$ satisfying the following conditions:
(1) vertices $A, D$ lie on ray $OP$ and vertices lie on ray $OQ$,
(2) diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect in $M$,
(3) $AB=m$.
Prove that your construction is correct and discuss conditions of solvability.
