For each date of year $1998$, we calculate day$^{month}$ âˆ’year and determine the greatest power of $3$ that divides it. For example, for April $21$ we get $21^4 - 1998 =192483 = 3^3 \cdot 7129$, which is divisible by $3^3$ and not by $3^4$ . Find all dates for which this power of $3$ is the greatest.
