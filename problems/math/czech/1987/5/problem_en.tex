Consider a table with three rows and eleven columns. There are zeroes prefilled in the cell of the first row and the first column and in the cell of the second row and the last column. Determine the least real number $\alpha$ such that the table can be filled with non-negative numbers and the following conditions hold simultaneously:
(1) the sum of numbers in every column is one,
(2) the sum of every two neighboring numbers in the first row is at most one,
(3) the sum of every two neighboring numbers in the second row is at most one,
(4) the sum of every two neighboring numbers in the third row is at most $\alpha$.
