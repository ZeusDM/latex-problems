In acute triangle ABC, which is not equilateral, let $P$ denote the foot of the altitude from $C$ to side $AB$; let $H$ denote the orthocenter; let $O$ denote the circumcenter; let $D$ denote the intersection of line $CO$ with $AB$; and let $E$ denote the midpoint of $CD$. Prove that line $EP$ passes through the midpoint of $OH$.
