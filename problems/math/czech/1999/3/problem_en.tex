Show that there exists a triangle $ABC$ such that $a \ne b$ and $a+t_a = b+t_b$, where $t_a,t_b$ are the medians corresponding to $a,b$, respectively. Also prove that there exists a number $k$ such that every such triangle satisfies $a+t_a = b+t_b = k(a+b)$. Finally, find all possible ratios $a : b$ in such triangles.
