Let be given an isosceles triangle $ABC$ with the base $AB$. A point $P$ is chosen on the altitude $CD$ so that the incircles of $ABP$ and $PECF$ are congruent, where E and F are the intersections of $AP$ and $BP$ with the opposite sides of the triangle, respectively. Prove that the incircles of triangles $ADP$ and $BCP$ are also congruent.
