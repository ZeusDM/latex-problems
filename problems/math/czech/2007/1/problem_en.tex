A stone is placed in a square of a chessboard with $n$ rows and $n$ columns. We can alternately undertake two operations:
\textit{(a)} move the stone to a square that shares a common side with the square in which it stands;
\textit{(b)} move it to a square sharing only one common vertex with the square in which it stands.

In addition, we are required that the first step must be \textit{(b)}. Find all integers $n$ such that the stone can go through a certain path visiting every square exactly once.
