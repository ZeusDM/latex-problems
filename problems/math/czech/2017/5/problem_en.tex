Given is the acute triangle $ABC$ with the intersection of altitudes $H$.  The angle bisector of angle $BHC$ intersects side $BC$ at point $D$. Mark $E$ and $F$ the symmetrics of the point $D$ wrt lines $AB$ and $AC$. Prove that the circle circumscribed around the triangle $AEF$ passes through the midpoint of the arc $BAC$
