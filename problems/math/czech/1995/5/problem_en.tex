Let $A,B$ be points on a circle $k$ with center $S$ such that $\angle ASB = 90^o$ . Circles $k_1$ and $k_2$ are tangent to each other at $Z$ and touch $k$ at $A$ and $B$ respectively. Circle $k_3$ inside $\angle ASB$ is internally tangent to $k$ at $C$ and externally tangent to $k_1$ and $k_2$ at $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Prove that $\angle XCY = 45^o$
