Define a ``round'' to be a sequence of consecutive minutes $m+1,m+2,\ldots,m+k$ such that at minutes $m$ and $m+k$, Lucas had to reset to square $0$ or Lucas advances to square $5$ while at minutes $m+1,m+2,\ldots,m+k-1$, Lucas did not reset to square $0$ and did not advance to square $5$. (Set Lucas to reset to square $0$ at minute $0$ so that every minute in the game is in a round). Note that $k\leq9$, otherwise by minute $m+10$, Wanda or Lucas must have either reached a multiple of $5$. We say that Wanda ``wins'' the round if Lucas resets to square $0$ and ``loses'' the round if Lucas advances to square $5$. Note that by symmetry, there is a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of Wanda winning a given round and a $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of Wanda losing a given round.

Thus, the probability that the game ends with Wanda reaching square $35$ is the probability that she wins $7$ consecutive rounds, which is $\frac{1}{128}$. By complementary counting, the probability that the game ends with Lucas reaching square $5$ is $1-\frac{1}{128}=\boxed{\frac{127}{128}}$.
