Wanda and Lucas are playing a game with squares for each integer from $0$ to $35$, inclusive. They both start at square $0$. Every minute, a fair standard coin is flipped. Assume that Wanda is currently at square $a$ and Lucas is at square $b$. If it turns up heads, Wanda moves from square $a$ to square $a+1$ and if it turns up tails, Lucas moves from square $b$ to square $b+1$. There is an additional condition that if in a move, Wanda moves from a square that is not a multiple of five to a square that is a multiple of five, Lucas instantaneously moves back to square $0$. The game ends the second after either Wanda reaches square $35$ or Lucas reaches square $5$. Compute the probability that Lucas reaches square $5$.
