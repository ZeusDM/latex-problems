Note that the first five digits are in increasing order, while the last five are also, so all six digits are in increasing order. This is clearly sufficient, so we can pick any $6$ digits out of $1,2,\ldots,9$ and rearrange them in increasing order to form all possible integers we are considering. The number of ways to do this is $\binom{9}{6}=\boxed{84}$.
