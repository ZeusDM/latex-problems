Note that $500-42=458$ students play any of these three instruments. Let $T$, $V$, and $S$ be the sets of students who play the trumpet, violin, and Sousaphone, respectively. Note that by the last statement, \[\left|T\cap V\right|+\left|T\cap S\right|+\left|V\cap S\right|-2\left|T\cap V\cap S\right|=\left|T\cap V\cap S\right|+235.\] But note that \[235=\left|T\cap V\right|+\left|T\cap S\right|+\left|V\cap S\right|-3\left|T\cap V\cap S\right|\] is the number of students who play two of the instruments, so $458-235=223$ is the number of students who play either one or three instruments, which is the number of students at ARML Academy who play an odd number of these three instruments, so the answer is $\boxed{223}$.
