Let $T$ be the set of four-digit decimal integers $\underline{ARML}$ with four distinct positive digits such that \[\underline{AR}_{\underline{ML}}=\underline{ARM}_{\underline{L}},\] where subscripts are in decimal and all bases make sense. Compute \[\displaystyle\sum_{\underline{ARML}\in T}R\] (if a certain digit is repeated twice as $R$, include it twice in the sum).
