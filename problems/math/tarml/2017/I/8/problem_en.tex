Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=20$, $BC=17$, and $CA=23$. Define $D$ to be the intersection of the exterior angle bisectors of $\angle{ABC}$ and $\angle{ACB}$ and $E$ to be the projection of $D$ onto $BC$. There exist points $P$ and $Q$ on segments $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, such that $BC$, $PQ$, and the line through $D$ perpendicular to $AE$ are concurrent. Given that $AP$ and $AQ$ are integers, find the area of $\triangle{APQ}$.
