Let $S_m=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^ma_i$ for any positive integer $m$. I claim that $n$ must be $2\pmod3$. Assume that $n$ is divisible by $3$. Then $S_{n-1}>S_n$, so $n-1$ would have worked better, contradiction. Now, assume that $n$ is $1\pmod 3$. Then $S_{n-2}=S_n-1$, so $n-2$ would not have worked better only if $S_{n-2}=2017$ (because then $S_{n-2}>2017$ is not true but $S_n>2017$ is). But note that if $n=3k+1$, then \[S_{n-2}=3k-2+3k-1+\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^{k-2}\left(3i+1\right)+\left(3i+2\right)-\left(3i-3\right),\] which is divisible by $3$, so $S_{n-2}$ cannot equal $2017$, contradiction. Thus, $n\equiv2\pmod 3$.

Let $n=3k+2$ for some positive integer $k$. Then the sum is \begin{align*}\left(3k+1\right)+\left(3k+2\right)+\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^k\left(3i-2\right)+\left(3i-1\right)-3i&=\left(6k+3\right)+\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^k3i-3\\&=6k+3+\frac{3k\left(k-1\right)}{2}\\&=\frac{3\left(k+1\right)\left(k+2\right)}{2}.\end{align*} To solve the inequality $\frac{3\left(k+1\right)\left(k+2\right)}{2}>2017$, it suffices to find the positive solution to $\frac{3\left(x+1\right)\left(x+2\right)}{2}=2017$. This is equivalent to \[\left(x+1\right)\left(x+2\right)=1344+\frac{2}{3}.\] We then know that \[x^2<1344+\frac{2}{3}<\left(x+2\right)^2,\] so the solution for $x$ is approximately between $\sqrt{1344}-2\approx34.5$ and $\sqrt{1344}\approx36.5$. Thus, we know that the value of $k$ is around here also. We can test and see that at $k=35$, this is $1998$, while at $k=36$, this is $2109>2017$, so the value of $k$ is $36$. Thus, $n=3\cdot36+2=\boxed{110}$.
