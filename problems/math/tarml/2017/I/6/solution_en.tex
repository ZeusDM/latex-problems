It is clear that $f$ has a maximum value, specifically there is an integer $M\in S$ such that $f\left(t\right)=M$ for some $t\in S$ and $f\left(n\right)\leq M$ for all $n\in S$. Then \[M=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^Mf\left(i\right)\geq\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^M1=M,\] with equality if and only if $f\left(i\right)=1$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,M$. But equality holds, so $f\left(1\right)=1$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,M$. Now, I claim that all solutions are as follows: for some $M,m\in S$ with $m>M$, set $f\left(i\right)=1$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,M$, set $f\left(m\right)=M$, and for all remaining members of $S$, choose any member of $\left\{1,2,\ldots,M\right\}$ as $f$ at this point. It is clear that all of these work: since $f\left(n\right)\leq M$, we get that \[f\left(n\right)=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{f\left(n\right)}f\left(i\right)=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{f\left(n\right)}1=f\left(n\right)\] is consistent. Furthermore, all solutions must be of this form as described already.

Now, we know that $M\geq2014$. However, $M<2016$ because otherwise $f\left(2016\right)=1$. If $M=2014$, then only $f\left(2015\right)$ and $f\left(2017\right)$ can be decided. Both can be arbitrarily chosen from $\left\{1,2,\ldots,2014\right\}$, so there are $2014^2=4056196$ possibilities here. If $M=2015$, then only $f\left(2017\right)$ can be decided. But in fact, it must be $2015$, otherwise $f\left(n\right)=2015$ has no solutions, so there is only $1$ possibility here. Thus, there are $\boxed{4056197}$ possible functions that work.
