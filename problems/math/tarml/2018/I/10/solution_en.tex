First, we find all polynomials $P$ with integer coefficients satisfying the equation. Suppose $P$ is of degree $\leq2$, so write $P\left(x\right)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2$. Then \[a_0+a_1\left(a+b\right)+a_2\left(a+b\right)^2=a_0+a_1a+a_2a^2+a_0+a_1b+a_2b^2\] whenever $ab=1$, so $a_0=2a_2$. So any linear combination of $x^2+2$ and $x$ works. Now, suppose that $P$ is of degree $d\geq3$ and write $P\left(x\right)=\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^da_ix^i$. Then \[\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^da_i\left(x+\frac{1}{x}\right)^i=\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^da_i\left(x^i+\frac{1}{x^i}\right)\] for all real numbers $x\neq0$. Look at the $x^{n-2}$ coefficient. On the left hand side, it is $na_n+a_{n-2}$. On the right hand side, it is $a_{n-2}$, so $a_n=0$, contradiction. So $P$ does not work and hence all $P$ which work are of the form $ax^2+bx+2a$ for integers $a$ and $b$.

Since $2018$ is a root of $P$, we know that $\left(2018^2+2\right)a+2018b=0$, so $a=1009k$ and $b=-\left(1009\cdot2018+1\right)k$ for some integer $k$. We know that the magnitude of $k$ is bounded by $\frac{2017^3}{1009\cdot2018+1}$. Letting $n=1009$, this is $\frac{\left(2n-1\right)^3}{2n^2+1}=4n-6+\frac{2n+5}{2n^2+1}$, so all $k$ that work are from $-\left(4n-6\right)$ to $4n-6$, inclusive. So the total number of $k$ which work, and hence the total number of polynomials which work, is $8n-11=\boxed{8061}$.
