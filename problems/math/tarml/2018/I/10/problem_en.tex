Compute the number of polynomials $P\left(x\right)$ satisfying the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All coefficients of $P$ are integers with magnitude less than $2017^3$.
    \item $2018$ is a root of $P$.
    \item For all real numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $ab=1$, \[P\left(a+b\right)=P\left(a\right)+P\left(b\right).\]
\end{itemize}
