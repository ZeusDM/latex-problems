The probability that a card is tasty is $p=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{3}{13}-\frac{3}{52}=\frac{11}{26}$. By Bayes' Theorem, the probability that all three cards are tasty given that two cards are tasty is the probability that all three cards are tasty divided by the probability that two cards are tasty. The probability that all three are tasty is simply $p^3$, while the probability that two cards are tasty is $3p^2-3p^3+p^3$. So the probability we want is $\frac{p^3}{3p^2-2p^3}=\frac{p}{3-2p}=\boxed{\frac{11}{56}}$.
