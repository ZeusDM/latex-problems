In non-degenerate triangle $ABC$, $\angle{BAC}>20^\circ$. The exterior angle bisectors at $B$ and $C$ as well as the line passing through $A$ at a $20^\circ$ angle with line $AB$ and not passing through the interior of $\triangle{ABC}$ form a triangle which is similar to $\triangle{ABC}$. Compute all possible values of $\angle{BAC}$.
