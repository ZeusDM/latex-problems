In a recent competition, Ankit was solving a problem which involved finding positive integer solutions to $a^2-a=2\left(b^3-b\right)$. Given that the solutions to this equation are $\left(a,b\right)=\left(a_1,b_1\right),\left(a_2,b_2\right),\left(a_3,b_3\right),\ldots$ where $b_1<b_2<b_3<\ldots$, compute $a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4$.
