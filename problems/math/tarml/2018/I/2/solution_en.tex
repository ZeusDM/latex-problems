Factor as $a\left(a-1\right)=2\left(b-1\right)b\left(b+1\right)$. Clearly $\left(1,1\right)$ is a solution. $b=2$ works as $2\cdot1\cdot2\cdot3=4\cdot3$, so $\left(4,2\right)$ is a solution. $b=3$ does not work as $2\cdot2\cdot3\cdot4$ cannot be written as the product of two consecutive integers. $b=4$ does not work as $2\cdot3\cdot4\cdot5$ cannot be written as the product of two consecutive integers. $b=5$ works as $2\cdot4\cdot5\cdot6=16\cdot15$, so $\left(16,5\right)$ is a solution. $b=6$ works as $2\cdot5\cdot6\cdot7=21\cdot20$, so $\left(21,6\right)$ is a solution. So the sum of the first four values of $a$ is $1+4+16+21=\boxed{42}$.
