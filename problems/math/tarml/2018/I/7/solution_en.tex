Consider the function $f\left(x\right)=2^{3\cdot2^x}-2^{2^x}-1$, of which our value of $x$ in the problem statement is the only real root. Observe that \[f\left(-1\right)=2^{\frac{3}{2}}-2^{\frac{1}{2}}-1=2^{-\frac{1}{2}}\left(2^2-2-\sqrt{2}\right)>0.\] Meanwhile, \[f\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)=2^{\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}}-2^{\frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}}}-1<2^{\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}}-2^{\frac{1}{3}}-1.\] Since $\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}$ is barely greater than $1$, $2^{\frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}}$ is barely greater than $2$, while $2^{\frac{1}{3}}$ is significantly greater than $1$, so this quantity is negative. Thus, the root of $f$ lies strictly betwen $-\frac{3}{2}$ and $-1$, so $\left\lfloor2x\right\rfloor=\boxed{-3}$.
