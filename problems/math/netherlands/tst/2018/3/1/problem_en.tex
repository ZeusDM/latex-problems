A set of lines in the plan is called nice i f every line in the set intersects an odd number of other lines in the set.

Determine the smallest integer $k \ge  0$ having the following property:

for each $2018$ distinct lines $\ell_1, \ell_2, ..., \ell_{2018}$ in the plane, there exist lines $\ell_{2018+1},\ell_{2018+2}, . . . , \ell_{2018+k}$ such that the lines $\ell_1, \ell_2, ..., \ell_{2018+k}$ are distinct and form a nice  set.
