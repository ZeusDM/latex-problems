In a non-isosceles triangle $ABC$ the centre of the incircle is denoted by $I$. The other intersection point of the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ and the circumcircle of $\vartriangle ABC$ is $D$. The line through $I$ perpendicular to $AD$ intersects $BC$ in $F$. The midpoint of the circle arc $BC$ on which $A$ lies, is denoted by $M$. The other intersection point of the line $MI$ and the circle through $B, I$ and $C$,  is denoted by $N$. Prove that $FN$ is tangent to the circle through $B, I$ and $C$.
