Let $n \ge  0$ be an integer. A sequence $a_0,a_1,a_2,...$ of integers is defined as follows:

we have $a_0 = n$ and for $k \ge 1, a_k$ is the smallest integer greater than $a_{k-1}$ for which $a_k +a_{k-1}$ is the square of an integer.

Prove that there are exactly $\lfloor \sqrt{2n}\rfloor$  positive integers that cannot be written in the form $a_k - a_{\ell}$ with $k > \ell\ge  0$.
