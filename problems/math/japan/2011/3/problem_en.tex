Person $A$ writes down  non negative integers in each $N$ grid running in a line horizontally. When $A$ says one non negative integer,

Person $B$ replaces some number in $N$ grid by the number that $A$

 said. Repeat this procedure, when these numbers are arranged in the 

order of monotone increasing in the wider sense, the procedure is over. 

Is it possible that $B$ can finish in regard less of $A$?
