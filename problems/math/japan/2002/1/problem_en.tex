Distinct points $ A,M,B$ with $ AM = MB$ are given on circle $ (C_0)$ in this order. Let $ P$ be a point on the arc $ AB$ not containing $ M$. Circle $ (C_1)$ is internally tangent to $ (C_0)$ at $ P$ and tangent to $ AB$ at $ Q$. Prove that the product $ MP\cdot MQ$ is independent of the position of $ P$.
