Let $ S$ be a set of 2002 points in the coordinate plane, no two of which have the same $ x-$ or $ y-$coordinate. For any two points $ P,Q \in S$, consider the rectangle with one diagonal $ PQ$ and the sides parallel to the axes. Denote by $ W_{PQ}$ the number of points of $ S$ lying in the interior of this rectangle. Determine the maximum $ N$ such that, no matter how the points of $ S$ are distributed, there always exist points $ P,Q$ in $ S$ with $ W_{PQ}\ge N$.
