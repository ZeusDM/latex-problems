There are $ n \ge 3$

 coins on a circle. Consider a coin and the two coins adjacent to it; if

 there are an odd number of heads among the three, we call it good. An operation consists of turning over all good coins simultaneously. Initially, exactly one of the $ n$ coins is a head. The operation is repeatedly performed.

(a) Prove that if $ n$ is odd, the coins will never be all-tails.

(b) For which values of $ n$ is it possible to make the coins all-tails after several operations? Find, in terms of $ n$, the number of operations needed for this to occur.
