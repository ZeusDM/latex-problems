Let $N$ be a positive integer. There are positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2},\cdots, a_{N}$ and all of them are not multiples of $2^{N+1}$. For each integer $n\geq N+1$, set $a_{n}$ as below:

If the remainder of $a_{k}$ divided by $2^{n}$ is the smallest of the remainder of $a_{1},\cdots, a_{n-1}$ divided by $2^{n}$, set $a_{n}=2a_{k}$. If there are several integers $k$ which satisfy the above condition, put the biggest one.

Prove the existence of a positive integer $M$ which satisfies $a_{n}=a_{M}$ for $n\geq M$.
