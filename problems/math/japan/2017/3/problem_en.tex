Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with the circumcenter $O$. Let $D,E$ and $F$ be the feet of the altitudes from $A,B$ and $C$, respectively, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. $AD$ and $EF$ meet at $X$, $AO$ and $BC$ meet at $Y$, and let $Z$ be the midpoint of $XY$. Prove that $A,Z,M$ are collinear.
