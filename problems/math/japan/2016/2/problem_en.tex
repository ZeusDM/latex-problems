Let $ABCD$ be a concyclic quadrilateral such that $AB:AD=CD:CB.$ The line $AD$ intersects the line $BC$ at $X$, and the line $AB$ intersects the line $CD$ at $Y$. Let $E,\ F,\ G$ and $H$ are the midpoints of the edges $AB,\ BC,\ CD$ and $DA$ respectively. The bisector of angle $AXB$ intersects the segment $EG$ at $S$, and that of angle $AYD$ intersects the segment $FH$ at $T$. Prove that the lines $ST$ and $BD$ are pararell.
