$m,n$ are positive integers such that $m\ge 2$, $n < \frac{3}{2}(m-1)$. In a country there are $m$ cities and $n$

 roads, each road connect two different cities, and there can be 

multiple roads between two cities. Prove that there exist a way to 

separate the cities into two groups $\alpha$ and $\beta$, where all roads connecting a city in $\alpha$ to a city in $\beta$ is converted to a highway, and satisfies the following conditions:

Both groups have at least one city, andfor each city, the number of highways coming out from that city does not exceed $1$.
