Given two planes $\pi _1,\ \pi _2$ intersecting orthogonally in space. Let $A,B$ be two distinct points on the line of intersection of $\pi _1$ and $\pi _2,$ and $C$ be the point which is on  $\pi _2$ but not on $\pi_1.$ Denote by $P$ the intersection point of the bisector of $\angle {BCA}$ and $AB$, and denote $S$ by the circumference on $\pi _1$ with a diameter $AB.$ For an arbiterary plane $\pi _3$ which contains $CP,$ if $D,E$ are the intersection points of $\pi_3$ and $S,$ then prove that $CP$ is the bisector of $\angle {DCE}.$
