In a land any towns are connected

 by roads with exactly other three towns. Last year we made a trip 

starting from a town coming back to the town by visiting exactly one 

time all towns in land. This year we are plan to make a trip in the same

 way as last year's trip. Note that you can't take such order completely

 same as last year's one or trace the order only reversely. Prove that 

this is possible.
