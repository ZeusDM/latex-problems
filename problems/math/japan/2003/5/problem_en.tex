Find the greatest possible integer $n$ such that one can place $n$ points in a plane with no three on a line, and color each of them either red, green, or yellow so that:

(i) inside each triangle with all vertices red there is a green point.

(ii) inside each triangle with all vertices green there is a yellow point.

(iii) inside each triangle with all vertices yellow there is a red point.
