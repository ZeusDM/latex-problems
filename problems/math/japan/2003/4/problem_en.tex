Let $p,q\geq 2$ be coprime integers. A list of integers $(r,a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n})$ with $|a_{i}|\geq 2$ for all $i$ is said to be an expansion of $p/q$ if$\frac{p}{q}=r+\frac{1}{a_{1}+\frac{1}{a_{2}+\frac{1}{...+\frac{1}{a_{n}}}}}$.

Now define the weight of an expansion $(r,a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n})$ to be the product$(|a_{1}|-1)(|a_{2}|-1)...(|a_{n}|-1)$.

Show that the sum of the weights of all expansions of $p/q$ is $q$.
