Call the Graph the set which composed of several vertices $P_1,\ \cdots P_2$ and several edges $($segments$)$ connecting two points among these vertices. Now let $G$ be a graph with 9 vertices and satisfies the following condition.

Condition: Even if we select any five points from the vertices in $G,$ there exist at least two edges whose endpoints are included in the set of 5 points.

What is the minimum possible numbers of edges satisfying the condition?
