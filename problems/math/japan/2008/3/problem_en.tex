Given an acute-angled triangle $ ABC$ with circumcenter $ O.$ The circle passing through two points $ A,\ O$ intersects with the line $ AB$ and $ AC$ at $ P,\ Q$ other than $ A$ respectively. If the lengths of the line segments $ PQ,\ BC$ are equal, then find the angle $ \leq 90^\circ$ that the lines $ PQ$ and $ BC$ make.
