Let $a$ be a fixed positive integer. For a given positive integer $n$, consider the following assertion.

In an infinite two-dimensional grid of squares, $n$ different cells are colored black. Let $K$ denote the number of $a$ by $a$ squares in the grid containing exactly $a$ black cells. Then over all possible choices of the $n$ black cells, the maximum possible $K$ is $a(n+1-a)$.

Prove that there exists a positive integer $N$ such that for all $n\ge N$, this assertion is true.
