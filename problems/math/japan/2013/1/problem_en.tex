Let $n, k$ be positive integers with $n \geq k$. There are $n$ persons, each person belongs to exactly one of group $1$, group $2,\ \dots$, group $k$ and more than or equal to one person belong to any  groups.

Show that $n^2$ sweets can be delivered to $n$ persons in such way that all of the following condition are satisfied:

\begin{itemize}
	\item At least one sweet are delivered to each person.
	\item $a_i$ sweet are delivered to each person belonging to group $i\ (1\leq i\leq k).$
	\item If $1 \leq i < j \leq k$, then $a_i \ge a_j.$
\end{itemize}
