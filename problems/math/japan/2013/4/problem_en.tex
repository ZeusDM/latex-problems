Given an acute-angled triangle ABC, let $H$ be the orthocenter. A cirlcle passing through the points $B,\ C$ and a cirlcle with a diameter $AH$ intersect at two distinct points $X,\ Y$. Let $D$ be the foot of the perpendicular drawn from $A$ to line $BC$, and let $K$ be the foot of the perpendicular drawn from $D$ to line $XY$. Show that $\angle{BKD}=\angle{CKD}$.
