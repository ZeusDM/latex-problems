You are the boss. You have ten men and there are ten tasks. Your men have two parameters to each task, one is enthusiasm, the other is ability.Now you are to assign the tasks to your men one by one.When man $A$ has more enthusiasm about task $v$ than about task $u,$ and man $A$ has better ability in task $v$ than man $B$ does, though if you assign task $u$ to man $A$ and task $v$ to man $B,$ man $A$

 feel unsatisfied.Or, if there is a more efficient way than yours that 

you can assign each task to men with better ability, you will be brought

 to account by your employer.Prove that there is a way to assign tasks 

without any dissatisfaction or disadvantage.
