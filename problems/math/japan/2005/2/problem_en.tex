Let $P(x,y),Q(x,y)$ be two-variable polynomials with the coefficients of integer.Supposed that when $a_n,b_n$ are determined for certain integers $a_0,\ b_0$ by $a_{n+1}=P(a_n,b_n),\ \ b_{n+1}=Q(a_n,b_n)\ \ (n=0,1,2,\cdots)$ there existed positive integer $k$ such that $(a_1,b_1)\neq (a_0,b_0)$ and $(a_k,b_k)=(a_0,b_0)$.Prove that the number of  the lattice points on the segment with end points of $(a_n,b_n)$ and $(a_{n+1},b_{n+1})$ is indepedent of $n$.
