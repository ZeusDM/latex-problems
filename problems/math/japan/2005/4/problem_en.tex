Given two points $A$ and $B$ on a circle $\varGamma$. Let the tangents to this circle $\varGamma$ at the points $A$ and $B$ meet at a point $X$. Let $C$ and $D$ be two points on the circle $\varGamma$ such that the points $C$, $D$, $X$ are collinear in this order and such that the lines $CA$ and $BD$ are perpendicular.

Let the line $CA$ intersect the line $BD$ at a point $F$.

Let the line $CD$ intersect the line $AB$ at a point $G$.

Let $H$ be the point of intersection of the segment $BD$ and the perpendicular bisector of the segment $GX$.

Prove that the four points $X$, $F$, $G$, $H$ lie on one circle.
