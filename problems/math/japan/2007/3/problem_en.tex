Let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of triangle $ABC.$ Denote the circle which touches to the sides $AB, \ AC$ and touches to $\Gamma$ internally at $P$ by $\Gamma_{A},$ and the circle which touches to the sides $AB, \ BC$ and touches to $\Gamma$ internally at $Q$ by $\Gamma_{B},$ and the circle which touches to the sides $AC, \ BC$ and touches to $\Gamma$ internally at $R$ by $\Gamma_{C}.$ Prove that the lines $AP,\ BQ,\ CR$ are concurrent.
