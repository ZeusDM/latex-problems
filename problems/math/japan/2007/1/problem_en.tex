Let $n$ be positive integers. Two persons play a game in which they are calling a integer $m\ (1\leq m\leq n)$

 alternately. Note that you may not call the number which have already 

said. The game is over when no one can call numbers, if the sum of the 

numbers that the lead have said  is divisible by 3, then the lead wins, 

otherwise the the second move wins. Find $n$ for which there exists the way of forestalling.
