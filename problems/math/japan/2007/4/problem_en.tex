On a plane, call the band with width $d$ be the set of all points which are away the distance of less than or equal to $\frac{d}{2}$ from a line.Given four points $A,\ B,\ C,\ D$ on a plane.If you take three points among them, there exists the band with width $1$ containing them. Prove that there exist the band with width $\sqrt{2}$ containing all four points .
