Let $ A$ be a set of $ n\geq 2$ points on a plane. Prove that there exists a circle which contains at least $ \left[\frac{n}{3}\right]$ points of $ A$ among circles (involving perimeter) with some end points taken from $ A$ as the diameter, where $ [x]$ is the greatest integer which is less than or equal to $ x$.
