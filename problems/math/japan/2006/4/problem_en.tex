Let $m,\ n$ be integers such that $2\leq m\leq n$ and let $a,\ a'$ be integers which are less than or equal to $m$ and let $b,\ b'$ be integers which are less than or equal to $n$ such that $(a,b)\neq (a'\ b').$ Given a town of the rectangular shaped chessboard which is made up of $m's$ road running north and south which is called Line and $n's$ road running west and east which is called Street. Denote the intersection point of the $a$ th Line from the west and $b$ th Street from the north by $A$, and $a'$ th Line from the west and $b'$ th Street from the north by $B,$ including the edge for both cases.Find all pair of $(m,n,a,b,a', b')$ such that by passing through each crossroads of the town exactly one time, you can reach the point $B$ from the point $A$ including in the start point and goal one.
