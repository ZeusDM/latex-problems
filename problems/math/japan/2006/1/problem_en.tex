Given five distinct points $A,M,B,C,D$ in this order on the circumference of the circle $O$ such that $MA=MB.$

Let $P,Q$ be the intersection points of the line $AC$ and $MD$, and that of the line $BD$ and $MC,$ respectively.

If two intersection points of the line $PQ$ and the circumference of the circle $O$ are $X,\ Y,$ then prove that $MX=MY.$
