Given a convex $2010$ polygonal whose any 3 diagonals have no intersection points except vertices. Consider  closed broken lines which have $2010$

 diagonals (not including edges) and they pass through each vertex 

exactly one time. Find the possible maximum value of the number of 

self-crossing. Note that we call closed broken lines such that broken line $P_1P_2\cdots P_nP_{n+1}$ has the property $P_1=P_{n+1}.$
