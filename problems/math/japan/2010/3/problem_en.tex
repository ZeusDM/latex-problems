There are $2010$ islands and $2009$

 bridges connecting them. Suppose that any bridges are connected by one 

bridge or not the endpoints are connected to 2 distinct islands and we 

can travel a few times by crossing bridges from each island to any other

 islands.

Now a letter from each island was sent to some island, note that, some 

letter may sent to same island, then the following fact was proved that:

In case of connecting island $A$ and island $B$ by bridge, the habitant of island $A$ and that of island $B$ are mutually connected by bridge or the same island (itself).

Prove that at least one of the following statements (1) or (2) hold.

(1) There exists island for which a letter was sent to the same island.

(2) There exist 2 islands, connecting bridge, whose letter are exchanged each other.
