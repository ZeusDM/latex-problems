Given an acute-angled triangle $ ABC$ such that $ AB\neq AC$. Draw the perpendicular $ AH$ from $ A$ to $ BC$. Suppose that if we take points $ P,\ Q$ in such a way that three points $ A,\ B,\ P$ and three points $ A,\ C,\ Q$ are collinear in this order respectively, then we have four points $ B,\ C,\ P,\ Q$ are concyclic and $ HP = HQ$. Prove that $ H$ is the circumcenter of $ \triangle{APQ}$.
