Let $n$ be an odd positive integer, and consider an infinite square grid. Prove that it is impossible to fill in one of $1,2$ or $3$ in every cell, which simultaneously satisfies the following conditions:

(1) Any two cells which share a common side does not have the same number filled in them.

(2) For any $1\times 3$ or $3\times 1$ subgrid, the numbers filled does not contain $1,2,3$ in that order be it reading from top to bottom, bottom to top, or left to right, or right to left.

(3) The sum of numbers of any $n\times n$ subgrid is the same.
