Given a scalene triangle $\triangle ABC$, $D,E$ lie on segments $AB,AC$ respectively such that $CA=CD, BA=BE$. Let $\omega$ be the circumcircle of $\triangle ADE$. $P$ is the reflection of $A$ across $BC$, and $PD,PE$ meets $\omega$ again at $X,Y$ respectively. Prove that $BX$ and $CY$ intersect on $\omega$.
