Positive integers between $1$ to $100$ inclusive are written on a blackboard, each exactly once. One operation involves choosing two numbers $a$ and $b$ on the blackboard and erasing them, then writing the greatest common divisor of $a^2+b^2+2$ and $a^2b^2+3$.

 After a number of operations, there is only one positive integer left 

on the blackboard. Prove this number cannot be a perfect square.
