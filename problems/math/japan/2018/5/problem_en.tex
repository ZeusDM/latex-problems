Let $T$ be a positive integer. Find all functions $f: \mathbb {Z}^+ \times \mathbb {Z}^+ \to \mathbb {Z}^+$, such that there exists integers $C_0,C_1,\ldots ,C_T$ satisfying:

(1) For any positive integer $n$, the number of positive integer pairs $(k,l)$ such that $f(k,l)=n$ is exactly $n$.

(2) For any $t=0,1,\ldots ,T,$ as well as for any positive integer pair $(k,l)$, the equality $f(k+t,l+T-t)-f(k,l)=C_t$ holds.
