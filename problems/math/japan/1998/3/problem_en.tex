Let $ P_{1}, \ldots P_{n}$

 be the sequence of vertices of a closed polygons whose sides may 

properly intersect each other at points other than the vertices. The 

external angle at $ P_{i}$ is defined as $ 180^\circ$ minus the angle of rotation about $ P_{i}$ required to bring the ray $ P_{i}P_{i-1}$ onto the ray $ P_{i}P_{i+1}$, taken in the range ($ 0^\circ, 360^\circ$). (Here $ P_{0}=P_{n}$ and $ P_{1}=P_{n+1}$). Prove that if the sum of the external angles is a multiple of $ 720^\circ$, then the number of self-intersections is odd.
