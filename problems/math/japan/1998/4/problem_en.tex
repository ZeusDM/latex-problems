Let $ c_{n, m}$ be the number of permutations of $ \{1, \ldots, n\}$ which can be written as the product of $ m$ transpositions of the form $ (i, i+1)$ for some $ i=1, \ldots, n-1$ but not of $ m-1$ suct transpositions. Prove that for all $ n \in \mathbb{N}$,\[ \sum_{m=0}^\infty c_{n, m}t^{m}= \prod_{i=1}^{n}(1+t+\cdots+t^{i-1}). \]
