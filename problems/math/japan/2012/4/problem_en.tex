Given two triangles $PAB$ and $PCD$ such that $PA=PB,\ PC=PD,\ P,\ A,\ C$ and $B,\ P,\ D$ are collinear in this order respectively.

The circle $S_1$ passing through $A,\ C$ intersects with the circle $S_2$ passing through $B,\ D$ at distinct points $X,\ Y$.

Prove that the circumcenter of the triangle $PXY$ is the midpoint of the centers of $S_1,\ S_2$.
