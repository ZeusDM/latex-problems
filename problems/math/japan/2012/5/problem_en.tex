Given is a piece at the origin of the coordinate plane. Two persons $A,\ B$ act as following.

First, $A$ marks on a lattice point, on which the piece cannot be anymore put. Then $B$ moves the piece from the point $(x,\ y)$ to the point $(x+1,\ y)$ or $(x,\ y+1)$, a number of $m$ times $(1\leq m\leq k)$. Note that we may not move the piece to a marked point. If $A$ wins when $B$ can't move any pieces, then find all possible integers $k$ such that $A$ will win in a finite number of moves, regardless of how $B$ moves the piece.
