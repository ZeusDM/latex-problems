Let $ N$ be postive integer. Some integers are written in a black board and those satisfy the following conditions.

1. Any numbers written are integers which are from 1 to $ N$.

2. More than one integer which is from 1 to $ N$ is written.

3. The sum of numbers written is even.

If we mark $ X$ to some numbers written and mark $ Y$  to all remaining numbers, then prove that we can set the sum of numbers marked $ X$ are equal to that of numbers marked $ Y$.
