In a school, there are $n$ students and some of them are friends each other. (Friendship is mutual.) Define $ a, b $ the minimum value which satisfies the following conditions:

(1) We can divide students into $ a $ teams such that two students in the same team are always friends.

(2) We can divide students into $ b $ teams such that two students in the same team are never friends.

Find the maximum value of $ N = a+b $ in terms of $n$.
