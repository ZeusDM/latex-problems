Let $ABC$ be a triangle with its inceter $I$, incircle $w$, and let $M$ be a midpoint of the side $BC$. A line through the point $A$ perpendicular to the line $BC$ and a line through the point $M$ perpendicular to the line $AI$ meet at $K$. Show that a circle with line segment $AK$ as the diameter touches $w$.
