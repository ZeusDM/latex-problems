Let $S$ be a set which is comprised of positive integers. We call $S$ a $\it{beautiful\ number}$ when the element belonging to $S$ of which any two distinct elements $x,\ y,\ z$, at least of them  will be a divisor of $x+y+z$. Show that there exists an integer $N$ satisfying the following condition, and also determine the smallest $N$ as such :

For any set S of $\it{beautiful\ number}$, there exists, $n_{s}\geq 2$  being an integer, the number of the element belonging to $S$ which is not a multiple of $n_s$, is less than or equal to $N$.
