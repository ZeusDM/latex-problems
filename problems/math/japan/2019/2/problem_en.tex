Let $n\geq 3$ be an odd number. We will play a game using a $n$ by $n$ grid. The game is comprised of $n^2$ turns, in every turn, we will perform the following operation sequentially.$\bullet$ We will choose a square with an unwritten integer, and write down an integer among 1 through $n^2$. We can write down any integer only at once through the game.$\bullet$ For each row, colum including the square, if the sum of integers is a multiple of $n$, then we will get 1 point (both of each sum is a multiple of $n$, we will get 2 points).}

Determine the maximum possible value of the points as the total sum that we can obtain by the end of the game.
