On Mars a basketball team consists of 6 players. The coach of the team Mars can select any line-up of 6 players among 100 candidates. The coach considers some line-ups as \textit{appropriate} while the other line-ups are not (there exists at least one appropriate line-up). A set of 5 candidates is called \textit{perspective} if one more candidate could be added to it to obtain an appropriate line-up. A candidate is called \textit{universal} if he completes each perspective set of 5 candidates (not containing him) upto an appropriate line-up. The coach has selected a line-up of 6 universal candidates. Determine if it follows that this line-up is appropriate.
