$100$ points are marked in the plane so that  no three of marked points are collinear. One of marked points is red, and the others are blue. A triangle with vertices at blue points is called \textit{good} if the red point lies inside it. Determine if it is possible that the number of good triangles is not less than the half of the total number of traingles with vertices at blue points.
