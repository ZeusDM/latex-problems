Basil needs to solve an exercise on summing two fractions $\dfrac{a}{b}$ and $\dfrac{c}{d}$, where  $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ are some non-zero real numbers. But instead of summing he performed multiplication  (correctly). It appears that Basil's answer coincides with the correct answer to given exercise. Find the value of  $\dfrac{b}{a} + \dfrac{d}{c}$.
