The workers laid a floor of size $n\times n$ ($10 <n <20$) with two types of tiles: $2 \times 2$ and $5\times 1$. It turned out that they were able to completely lay the floor so that the same number of tiles of each type was used. For which $n$ could this happen?
(You canâ€™t cut tiles and also put them on top of each other.)
