On the table are $300$ coins. Petya, Vasya and Tolya play the next game. They go in turn in the following order: Petya, Vasya, Tolya, Petya. Vasya, Tolya, etc. In one move, Petya can take $1, 2, 3$, or $4$ coins from the table, Vasya, $1$ or $2$ coins, and Tolya, too, $1$ or $2$ coins. Can Vasya and Tolya agree so that, as if Petya were playing, one of them two will take the last coin off the table?
