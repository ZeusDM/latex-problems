In the convex quadrilateral $ABCD$, point $K$ is the midpoint of $AB$, point $L$ is the midpoint of $BC$, point $M$ is the midpoint of CD, and point $N$ is the midpoint of $DA$. Let $S$ be a point lying inside the quadrilateral $ABCD$ such that $KS = LS$ and  $NS = MS$ .Prove that $\angle KSN =  \angle MSL$.
