The workers laid a floor of size $n \times n$ with tiles of two types: $2 \times  2$ and $3 \times  1$.
It turned out that they were able to completely lay the floor in such a way that the same number of tiles of each type was used. Under what conditions could this happen?
(You canâ€™t cut tiles and also put them on top of each other.)
