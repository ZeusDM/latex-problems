By \textit{centroid} of a quadrilateral $PQRS$ we call a common point of two lines through the midpoints of its opposite sides. Suppose that $ABCDEF$ is a hexagon inscribed into the circle $\Omega$ centered at $O$. Let  $AB=DE$, and  $BC=EF$. Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be centroids of $ABDE$, $BCEF$; and $CDFA$, respectively. Prove that $O$ is the orthocenter of triangle $XYZ$.
