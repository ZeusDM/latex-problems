For $2n$ positive integers a matching (i.e. dividing them into $n$ pairs) is called {\it non-square} if the product of two numbers in each pair is not a perfect square. Prove that if there is a non-square matching, then there are at least $n!$ non-square matchings.
(By $n!$ denote the product $1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot \ldots \cdot n$.)
