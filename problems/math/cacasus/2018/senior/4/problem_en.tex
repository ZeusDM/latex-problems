Morteza places a function $[0,1]\to [0,1]$ (that is a function with domain [0,1] and values from [0,1]) in each cell of an $n \times n$ board. Pavel wants to place a function $[0,1]\to [0,1]$ to the left of each row and below each column (i.e. to place $2n$ functions in total) so that the following condition holds for any cell in this board:
If $h$ is the function in this cell, $f$ is the function below its column, and $g$ is the function to the left of its row, then $h(x) = f(g(x))$ for all $x \in [0, 1]$.
Prove that Pavel can always fulfil his plan.
