Let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ be two non-intersecting circles. Let one of its internal tangents touches $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ at $A_1$ and $A_2$, respectively, and let one of its external tangents touches $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ at $B_1$ and $B_2$, respectively. Prove that if $A_1B_2 = A_2B_1$, then   $A_1B_2 \perp A_2B_1$.
