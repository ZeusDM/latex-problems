Morteza wishes to take two real numbers $S$ and $P$, and then to arrange six pairwise distinct real numbers on a circle so that for each three consecutive numbers at least one of the two following conditions holds:
1) their sum equals $S$
2) their product equals $P$.
Determine if Mortezaâ€™s wish could be fulfilled.
