Peter wrote $100$ distinct integers on a board. Basil needs to fill the cells of a table $100\times{100}$ with integers so that the sum in each rectangle $1\times{3}$ (either vertical, or horizontal) is equal to one of the numbers written on the board. Find the greatest $n$ such that, regardless of numbers written by Peter, Basil can fill the table so that it would contain each of numbers $(1,2,...,n)$ at least once (and possibly some other integers).
