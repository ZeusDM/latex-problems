On sides $BC$, $CA$, $AB$ of a triangle $ABC$ points $K$, $L$, $M$ are chosen, respectively, and a point $P$ is inside $ABC$ is chosen so that  $PL\parallel BC$, $PM\parallel CA$, $PK\parallel AB$. Determine if it is possible that each of  three trapezoids $AMPL$, $BKPM$, $CLPK$ has an inscribed circle.
