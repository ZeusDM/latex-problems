In the kindergarten there is a big box with balls of three colors: red, blue and green, 100 balls in total. Once Pasha took out of the box 30 red, 10 blue, and 20 green balls and played with them. Then he lost five balls and returned the others back into the box. The next day, Sasha took out of the box 8 red, 18 blue, and 48 green balls. Is it possible to determine the color of at least one lost ball?
