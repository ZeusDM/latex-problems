Consider some graph $G$ with $2019$ nodes. Let's define inverting a vertex $v$ the following process: for every other vertex $u$,  if there was an edge between $v$ and $u$,  it is deleted, and if there wasn't, it is added. We want to minimize the number of edges in the graph by several invertings (we are allowed to invert the same vertex several times). Find the smallest number $M$ such that we can always make the number of edges in the graph not larger than $M$,  for any initial choice of $G$.
