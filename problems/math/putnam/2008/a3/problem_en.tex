Start with a finite sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ of positive integers.
If possible, choose two indices $j < k$ such that $a_j$ does not divide
$a_k$, and replace $a_j$ and $a_k$ by $\mathrm{gcd}(a_j, a_k)$
and $\mathrm{lcm}(a_j, a_k)$, respectively. Prove that if this process is
repeated, it must eventually stop and the final sequence does not depend
on the choices made. (Note: gcd means greatest common divisor and lcm
means least common multiple.)
