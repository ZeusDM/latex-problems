Find all continuously differentiable functions $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$
such that for every rational number $q$, the number $f(q)$ is rational
and has the same denominator as $q$. (The denominator of a rational number
$q$ is the unique positive integer $b$ such that $q = a/b$
for some integer $a$ with $\mathrm{gcd}(a,b) = 1$.)
(Note: gcd means greatest common
divisor.)
