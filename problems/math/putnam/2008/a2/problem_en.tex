Alan and Barbara play a game in which they take turns filling entries of
an initially empty $2008 \times 2008$ array. Alan plays first. At each
turn, a player chooses a real number and places it in a vacant entry.
The game ends when all the entries are filled. Alan wins if the
determinant of the resulting matrix is nonzero; Barbara wins if it is zero.
Which player has a winning strategy?
