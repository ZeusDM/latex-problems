Let $n \geq 3$ be an integer.
Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials with real coefficients such that the points $(f(1), g(1))$, $(f(2), g(2))$, $\dots$, $(f(n), g(n))$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are the vertices of a regular $n$-gon in counterclockwise order.
Prove that at least one of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ has degree greater than or equal to $n-1$.
