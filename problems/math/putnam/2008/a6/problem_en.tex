Prove that there exists a constant $c>0$ such that in every
nontrivial finite group $G$ there exists a sequence of length
at most $c \log |G|$ with the property that each element of $G$
equals the product of some subsequence. (The elements of $G$ in the
sequence are not required to be distinct. A \emph{subsequence}
of a sequence is obtained by selecting some of the terms,
not necessarily consecutive, without reordering them; for
example, $4, 4, 2$ is a subsequence of $2, 4, 6, 4, 2$, but
$2, 2, 4$ is not.)
