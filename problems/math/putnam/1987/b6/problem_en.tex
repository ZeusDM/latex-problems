Let $F$ be the field of $p^2$ elements, where $p$ is an odd
prime. Suppose $S$ is a set of $(p^2-1)/2$ distinct nonzero elements
of $F$ with the property that for each $a\neq 0$ in $F$, exactly one
of $a$ and $-a$ is in $S$. Let $N$ be the number of elements in the
intersection $S \cap \{2a: a \in S\}$. Prove that $N$ is even.
