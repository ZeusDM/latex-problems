Let $O_n$ be the $n$-dimensional vector $(0,0,\cdots, 0)$. Let $M$ be
a $2n \times n$ matrix of complex numbers such that whenever $(z_1,
z_2, \dots, z_{2n})M = O_n$, with complex $z_i$, not all zero, then at
least one of the $z_i$ is not real. Prove that for arbitrary real
numbers $r_1, r_2, \dots, r_{2n}$, there are complex numbers $w_1,
w_2, \dots, w_n$ such that
\[
\mathrm{re}\left[ M \left( \begin{array}{c} w_1 \\ \vdots \\ w_n \end{array}
\right) \right] = \left( \begin{array}{c} r_1 \\ \vdots \\ r_n
\end{array} \right).
\]
(Note: if $C$ is a matrix of complex numbers, $\mathrm{re}(C)$ is the matrix
whose entries are the real parts of the entries of $C$.)
