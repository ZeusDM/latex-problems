The sequence of digits
\[
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 2 0 2 1 \dots
\]
is obtained by writing the positive integers in order. If the
$10^n$-th digit in this sequence occurs in the part of the sequence in
which the $m$-digit numbers are placed, define $f(n)$ to be $m$. For
example, $f(2)=2$ because the 100th digit enters the sequence in the
placement of the two-digit integer 55. Find, with proof, $f(1987)$.
