Let $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ be real numbers, and let $b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_n$ be distinct positive integers. Suppose that there is a polynomial
$f(x)$ satisfying the identity
\[
(1-x)^n f(x) = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^n a_i x^{b_i}.
\]
Find a simple expression (not involving any sums) for $f(1)$ in terms
of $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ and $n$ (but independent of $a_1, a_2,
\dots, a_n$).
