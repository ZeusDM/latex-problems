Let $\Gamma$ consist of all polynomials in $x$ with integer
coefficients. For $f$ and $g$ in $\Gamma$ and $m$ a positive integer,
let $f \equiv g \pmod{m}$ mean that every coefficient of $f-g$ is an
integral multiple of $m$. Let $n$ and $p$ be positive integers with
$p$ prime. Given that $f,g,h,r$ and $s$ are in $\Gamma$ with
$rf+sg\equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ and $fg \equiv h \pmod{p}$, prove that there
exist $F$ and $G$ in $\Gamma$ with $F \equiv f \pmod{p}$, $G \equiv g
\pmod{p}$, and $FG \equiv h \pmod{p^n}$.
