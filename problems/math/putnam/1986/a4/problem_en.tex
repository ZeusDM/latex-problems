A \emph{transversal} of an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ consists of $n$
entries of $A$, no two in the same row or column. Let $f(n)$ be the
number of $n \times n$ matrices $A$ satisfying the following two
conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Each entry $\alpha_{i,j}$ of $A$ is in the set
$\{-1,0,1\}$.
\item[(b)] The sum of the $n$ entries of a transversal is the same for
all transversals of $A$.
\end{enumerate}
An example of such a matrix $A$ is
\[
A = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} -1 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0
\end{array}
\right).
\]
Determine with proof a formula for $f(n)$ of the form
\[
f(n) = a_1 b_1^n + a_2 b_2^n + a_3 b_3^n + a_4,
\]
where the $a_i$'s and $b_i$'s are rational numbers.
