associate the determinant of the matrix obtained by writing the
digits in order across the rows. For example, for $n=2$, to the
integer 8617 we associate $\det \left(
 \begin{array}{cc} 8 & 6 \\
1 & 7 \end{array} \right) = 50$. Find, as a function of $n$, the
sum of all the determinants associated with $n^{2}$-digit
integers. (Leading digits are assumed to be nonzero; for example,
for $n=2$, there are 9000 determinants.)
