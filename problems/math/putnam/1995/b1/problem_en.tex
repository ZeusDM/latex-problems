let $\pi(x)$ be the number of elements in the part containing $x$.
Prove that for any two partitions $\pi$ and $\pi'$, there are two
distinct numbers $x$ and $y$ in $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$
such that $\pi(x) = \pi(y)$ and $\pi'(x) = \pi'(y)$. [A {\em
partition} of a set $S$ is a collection of disjoint subsets (parts)
whose union is $S$.]
