multiplication (that is, if $a$ and $b$ are in $S$, then so is $ab$).
Let $T$ and $U$ be disjoint subsets of $S$ whose union is $S$. Given
that the product of any {\em three} (not necessarily distinct)
elements of $T$ is in $T$ and that the product of any three elements
of $U$ is in $U$, show that at least one of the two subsets $T,U$ is
closed under multiplication.
