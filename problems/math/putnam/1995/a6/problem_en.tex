1,2,3 in random order in one column of a $3 \times n$ matrix, with
all orders equally likely and with the orders for different columns
independent of each other. Let the row sums $a,b,c$ of the resulting
matrix be rearranged (if necessary) so that $a \leq b \leq c$. Show
that for some $n \geq 1995$, it is at least four times as likely that
both $b=a+1$ and $c=a+2$ as that $a=b=c$.
