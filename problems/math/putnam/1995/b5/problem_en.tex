and 6 beans. The two players move alternately. A move consists of
taking \textbf{either}
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] one bean from a heap, provided at least two beans are
left behind in that heap, \textbf{or}

\item[b)] a complete heap of two or three beans.
\end{itemize}
The player who takes the last heap wins. To win the game, do you
