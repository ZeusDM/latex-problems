A $2 \times 3$ rectangle has vertices as $(0, 0), (2,0), (0,3),$ and $(2,
3)$. It rotates $90^\circ$ clockwise about the point $(2, 0)$. It then
rotates $90^\circ$ clockwise about the point $(5, 0)$, then $90^\circ$
clockwise about the point $(7, 0)$, and finally, $90^\circ$ clockwise
about the point $(10, 0)$. (The side originally on the $x$-axis is now
back on the $x$-axis.) Find the area of the region above the $x$-axis and
below the curve traced out by the point whose initial position is (1,1).
