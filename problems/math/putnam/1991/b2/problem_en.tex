Suppose $f$ and $g$ are non-constant, differentiable, real-valued
functions defined on $(-\infty, \infty)$. Furthermore, suppose that for
each pair of real numbers $x$ and $y$,
\begin{align*}
f(x+y) &= f(x)f(y) - g(x)g(y), \\
g(x+y) &= f(x)g(y) + g(x)f(y).
\end{align*}
If $f'(0) = 0$, prove that $(f(x))^2 + (g(x))^2 = 1$ for all $x$.
