Does there exist an infinite sequence of closed discs $D_1, D_2, D_3,
\dots$ in the plane, with centers $c_1, c_2, c_3, \dots$, respectively,
such that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the $c_i$ have no limit point in the finite plane,
    \item the sum of the areas of the $D_i$ is finite, and
    \item every line in the plane intersects at least one of the $D_i$?
\end{enumerate}
