Define a sequence by $a_0=1$, together with the rules
$a_{2n+1} = a_n$ and $a_{2n+2} = a_n + a_{n+1}$ for each
integer $n \geq 0$. Prove that every positive rational number
appears in the set
\[
\left\{ \frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}: n \geq 1 \right\} =
\left\{ \frac{1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{1}, \frac{1}{3},
\frac{3}{2}, \dots \right\}.
\]
