A palindrome in base $b$ is a positive integer whose base-$b$
digits read the same backwards and forwards; for example,
$2002$ is a 4-digit palindrome in base 10. Note that 200 is not
a palindrome in base 10, but it is the 3-digit palindrome
242 in base 9, and 404 in base 7. Prove that there is an integer
which is a 3-digit palindrome in base $b$ for at least 2002
different values of $b$.
