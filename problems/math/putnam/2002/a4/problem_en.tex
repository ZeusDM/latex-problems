In Determinant Tic-Tac-Toe, Player 1 enters a 1 in an empty
$3 \times 3$ matrix. Player 0 counters with a 0 in a vacant position,
and play continues in turn until the $3 \times 3$ matrix is
completed with five 1's and four 0's. Player 0 wins if the
determinant is 0 and player 1 wins otherwise. Assuming both
players pursue optimal strategies, who will win and how?
