An integer $n$, unknown to you, has been randomly chosen in the
interval $[1, 2002]$ with uniform probability. Your objective is
to select $n$ in an \textbf{odd} number of guesses. After
each incorrect guess, you are informed whether $n$ is higher
or lower, and you \textbf{must} guess an integer on your next turn
among the numbers that are still feasibly correct. Show that you
have a strategy so that the chance of winning is greater than $2/3$.
