Consider a polyhedron with at least five faces such that exactly three
edges emerge from each of its vertices. Two players play the following
game:
\begin{verse}
\noindent
Each player, in turn, signs his or her name on a previously
unsigned face. The winner is the player who first succeeds in
signing three faces that share a common vertex.
\end{verse}
Show that the player who signs first will always win by playing
as well as possible.
