Let $S$ be the smallest set of positive integers such that
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item $2$ is in $S$,
	\item $n$ is in $S$ whenever $n^2$ is in $S$, and
	\item $(n+5)^2$ is in $S$ whenever $n$ is in $S$.
\end{enumerate}

Which positive integers are not in $S?$ \emph{The set $S$ is ``smallest'' in the sense that $S$ is contained in any other such set.}
