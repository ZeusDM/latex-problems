Let $S$ be the smallest set of positive integers such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)]
$2$ is in $S$,
\item[(b)]
$n$ is in $S$ whenever $n^2$ is in $S$, and
\item[(c)]
$(n+5)^2$ is in $S$ whenever $n$ is in $S$.
\end{enumerate}
Which positive integers are not in $S$?

(The set $S$ is ``smallest'' in the sense that $S$ is contained in any other such set.)
