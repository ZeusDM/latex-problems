Let $S$ be the smallest set of positive integers such that

a) $2$ is in $S,$
b) $n$ is in $S$ whenever $n^2$ is in $S,$ and
c) $(n+5)^2$ is in $S$ whenever $n$ is in $S.$

Which positive integers are not in $S?$

(The set $S$ is ``smallest" in the sense that $S$ is contained in any other such set.)
