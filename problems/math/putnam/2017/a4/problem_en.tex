A class with $2N$ students took a quiz, on which the possible scores were $0,1,\dots,10$. Each of these scores
occurred at least once, and the average score was exactly $7.4$. Show that the class can be divided into two groups of $N$ students in such a way that the average score for each group was exactly $7.4$.
