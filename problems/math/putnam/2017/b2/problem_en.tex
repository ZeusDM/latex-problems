Suppose that a positive integer $N$ can be expressed as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers
\[N=a+(a+1)+(a+2)+\cdots+(a+k-1)\]for $k=2017$ but for no other values of $k>1.$ Considering all positive integers $N$ with this property, what is the smallest positive integer $a$ that occurs in any of these expressions?
