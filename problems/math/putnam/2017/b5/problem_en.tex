A line in the plane of a triangle $T$ is called an \textit{equalizer} if it divides $T$ into two regions having equal area and equal perimeter. Find positive integers $a>b>c,$ with $a$ as small as possible, such that there exists a triangle with side lengths $a,b,c$ that has exactly two distinct equalizers.
