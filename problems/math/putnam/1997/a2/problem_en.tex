Players $1,2,3,\ldots,n$ are seated around a table, and each has
a single penny.  Player 1 passes a penny to player 2, who then passes
two pennies to player 3.  Player 3 then passes one penny to Player 4,
who passes two pennies to Player 5, and so on, players alternately
passing one penny or two to the next player who still has some
pennies.  A player who runs out of pennies drops out of the game and
leaves the table.  Find an infinite set of numbers $n$ for which some
player ends up with all $n$ pennies.
