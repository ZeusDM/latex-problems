Let $G$ be a group with identity $e$ and $\phi:G\rightarrow G$
a function such that
\[\phi(g_1)\phi(g_2)\phi(g_3)=\phi(h_1)\phi(h_2)\phi(h_3)\]
whenever $g_1g_2g_3=e=h_1h_2h_3$.  Prove that there exists an element
$a\in G$ such that $\psi(x)=a\phi(x)$ is a homomorphism (i.e.
$\psi(xy)=\psi(x)\psi(y)$ for all $x,y\in G$).
