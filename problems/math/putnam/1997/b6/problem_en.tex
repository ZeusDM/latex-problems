The dissection of the 3--4--5 triangle shown below (into four
congruent right triangles similar to the original)
has diameter $5/2$.
Find the least diameter of a dissection of this triangle into four parts.
(The diameter of a dissection is the least upper bound of the distances
between pairs of points belonging to the same part.)
