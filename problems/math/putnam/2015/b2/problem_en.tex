Given a list of the positive integers $1,2,3,4,\dots$, take the first three numbers
$1,2,3$ and their sum $6$ and cross all four numbers off the list. Repeat with the three 
smallest remaining numbers $4,5,7$ and their sum $16$. Continue in this way, crossing off the three smallest remaining numbers and their sum, and consider the sequence of sums produced: $6, 16, 27, 36, \dots$. Prove or disprove that there is some number in the sequence whose base 10 representation ends with $2015$.
