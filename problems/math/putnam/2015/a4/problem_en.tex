For each real number $x,$ let \[f(x)=\sum_{n\in S_x}\frac1{2^n}\]where $S_x$ is the set of positive integers $n$ for which $\lfloor nx\rfloor$ is even.

What is the largest real number $L$ such that $f(x)\ge L$ for all $x\in [0,1)$?

(As usual, $\lfloor z\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $z.$
