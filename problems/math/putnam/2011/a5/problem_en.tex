Let $F:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ and $g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be twice continuously differentiable functions with the following properties:

• $F(u,u)=0$ for every $u\in\mathbb{R};$

• for every $x\in\mathbb{R},g(x)>0$ and $x^2g(x)\le 1;$

• for every $(u,v)\in\mathbb{R}^2,$ the vector $\nabla F(u,v)$ is either $\mathbf{0}$ or parallel to the vector $\langle g(u),-g(v)\rangle.$

Prove that there exists a constant $C$ such that for every $n\ge 2$ and any $x_1,\dots,x_{n+1}\in\mathbb{R},$ we have
\[\min_{i\ne j}|F(x_i,x_j)|\le\frac{C}{n}.\]
