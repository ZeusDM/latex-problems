continuously differentiable functions with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $F(u,u) = 0$ for every $u \in \RR$;
\item for every $x \in \RR$, $g(x) > 0$ and $x^2 g(x) \leq 1$;
\item for every $(u,v) \in \RR^2$, the vector $\nabla F(u,v)$ is either $\mathbf{0}$ or parallel to the vector $\langle g(u), -g(v) \rangle$.
\end{itemize}
Prove that there exists a constant $C$ such that for every $n\geq 2$ and any $x_1,\dots,x_{n+1} \in \RR$, we have
\[
\min_{i \neq j} |F(x_i,x_j)| \leq \frac{C}{n}.
\]
