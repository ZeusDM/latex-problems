of points with integer coordinates $P_0 = (0,0), P_1, \dots, P_n$ such
that $n \geq 2$ and:
\begin{itemize}
\item the directed line segments $P_0 P_1, P_1 P_2, \dots, P_{n-1} P_n$
are in the successive coordinate directions east (for $P_0 P_1$), north,
west, south, east, etc.;
\item the lengths of these line segments are positive and strictly
increasing.
\end{itemize} [Picture omitted.]  How many of the points $(x,y)$ with
integer coordinates $0\leq x\leq 2011, 0\leq y\leq 2011$ \emph{cannot}
be the last point, $P_n$ of any growing spiral?
