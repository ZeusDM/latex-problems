multiplayer game. Every game is played by all 2011 players together and
ends with each of the players either winning or losing. The standings
are kept in two $2011 \times 2011$ matrices, $T = (T_{hk})$ and $W =
(W_{hk})$. Initially, $T=W=0$. After every game, for every $(h,k)$ (including
for $h=k$), if players $h$ and $k$ tied (that is, both won or both lost),
the entry $T_{hk}$ is increased by 1, while if player $h$ won and player $k$
lost, the entry $W_{hk}$ is increased by 1 and $W_{kh}$ is decreased by 1.

Prove that at the end of the tournament, $\det(T+iW)$ is a non-negative
integer divisible by $2^{2010}$.
