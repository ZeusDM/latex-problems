\[ \{g_1=e,g_2,\dots,g_k\} \subsetneqq G \]
be a (not necessarily minimal) set of distinct generators of $G$. A special
die, which randomly selects one of the elements $g_1,g_2,...,g_k$ with equal
probability, is rolled $m$ times and the selected elements are multiplied
to produce an element $g \in G$.  Prove that there exists a real number
$b \in (0,1)$ such that

\[ \lim_{m\to\infty} \frac{1}{b^{2m}} \sum_{x\in G} \left(\mathrm{Prob}(g=x)
    - \frac{1}{n}\right)^2 \]
is positive and finite.
