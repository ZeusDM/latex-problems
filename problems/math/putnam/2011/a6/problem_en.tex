Let $G$ be an abelian group with $n$ elements, and let \[\{g_1=e,g_2,\dots,g_k\}\subsetneq G\] be a (not necessarily minimal) set of distinct generators of $G.$ A special die, which randomly selects one of the elements $g_1,g_2,\dots,g_k$ with equal probability, is rolled $m$ times and the selected elements are multiplied to produce an element $g\in G.$

Prove that there exists a real number $b\in(0,1)$ such that \[\lim_{m\to\infty}\frac1{b^{2m}}\sum_{x\in G}\left(\mathrm{Prob}(g=x)-\frac1n\right)^2\] is positive and finite.
