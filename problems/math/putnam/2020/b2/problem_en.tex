Let $k$ and $n$ be integers with $1 \leq k < n$. Alice and Bob play a game with $k$ pegs in a line of $n$ holes. At the beginning of the game, the pegs occupy the $k$ leftmost holes. A legal move consists of moving a single peg
to any vacant hole that is further to the right. The players alternate moves, with Alice playing first. The game ends when the pegs are in the $k$ rightmost holes, so whoever is next to play cannot move and therefore loses. For what values
of $n$ and $k$ does Alice have a winning strategy?
