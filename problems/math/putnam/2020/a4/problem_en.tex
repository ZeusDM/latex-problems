Consider a horizontal strip of $N+2$ squares in which the first and the last square are black and the remaining $N$ squares are all white. Choose a white square uniformly at random, choose one of its two neighbors with equal probability, and color tis neighboring square black if it is not already black. Repeat this process until all the remaining white squares have only black neighbors. Let $w(N)$ be the expected number of white squares remaining. Find
\[ \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{w(N)}{N}.\]
