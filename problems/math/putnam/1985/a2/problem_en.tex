Let $T$ be an acute triangle. Inscribe a rectangle $R$ in $T$ with one
side along a side of $T$. Then inscribe a rectangle $S$ in the triangle
formed by the side of $R$ opposite the side on the boundary of $T$,
and the other two sides of $T$, with one side along the side of
$R$. For any polygon $X$, let $A(X)$ denote the area of $X$. Find the
maximum value, or show that no maximum exists, of
$\frac{A(R)+A(S)}{A(T)}$, where $T$ ranges over all triangles and
$R,S$ over all rectangles as above.
