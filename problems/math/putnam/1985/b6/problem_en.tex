Let $G$ be a finite set of real $n\times n$ matrices $\{M_i\}$, $1
\leq i \leq r$, which form a group under matrix
multiplication. Suppose that $\sum_{i=1}^r \mathrm{tr}(M_i)=0$, where
$\mathrm{tr}(A)$
denotes the trace of the matrix $A$. Prove that $\sum_{i=1}^r M_i$ is
the $n \times n$ zero matrix.
