Let $C$ be the unit circle $x^2+y^2=1$. A point $p$ is chosen randomly
on the circumference $C$ and another point $q$ is chosen randomly from
the interior of $C$ (these points are chosen independently and
uniformly over their domains). Let $R$ be the rectangle with sides
parallel to the $x$ and $y$-axes with diagonal $pq$. What is the
probability that no point of $R$ lies outside of $C$?
