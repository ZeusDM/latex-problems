Let  $n$  be a positive integer. Starting with the sequence
$1$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{3}$, $\dots$, $\frac{1}{n}$,
form a new sequence of  $n-1$  entries
$\frac{3}{4}$, $\frac{5}{12}$, $\dots$, $\frac{2n-1}{2n(n-1)}$
by taking the averages of
two consecutive entries in the first sequence. Repeat the
averaging of neighbors on the second sequence to obtain a third
sequence of  $n-2$  entries, and continue until the final sequence produced
consists of a single number  $x_n$.  Show that  $x_n < 2/n$.
