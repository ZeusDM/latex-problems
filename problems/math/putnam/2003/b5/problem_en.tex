Let  $A,B$, and $C$  be equidistant points on the circumference of a circle
of unit radius centered at  $O$,  and let  $P$  be any point in the circle's
interior.  Let  $a, b, c$  be the distance from  $P$  to $A, B, C$,
respectively.
Show that there is a triangle with side lengths  $a, b, c$,  and that the
area of this triangle depends only on the distance from  $P$  to  $O$.
