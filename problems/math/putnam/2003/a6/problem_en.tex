For a set  $S$  of nonnegative integers, let  $r_S(n)$  denote the number of
ordered pairs  $(s_1, s_2)$  such that  $s_1 \in S$, $s_2 \in S$, $s_1 \ne
s_2$,
and  $s_1 + s_2 = n$.  Is it possible to partition the nonnegative
integers into two sets  $A$  and  $B$  in such a way that  $r_A(n) = r_B(n)$
for all  $n$ ?
