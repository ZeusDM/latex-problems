Let $n$ be a fixed positive integer. How many ways are there to write  $n$
as a sum of positive integers,  
\[
n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k,
\]
with  $k$  an
arbitrary positive integer and  $a_1 \le a_2 \le \cdots \le a_k \le a_1  + 1$?
For example, with $n=4$ there are four ways: 4, 2+2, 1+1+2, 1+1+1+1.
