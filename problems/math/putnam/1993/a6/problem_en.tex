The infinite sequence of 2's and 3's
\begin{align*}
&2,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,3,3, \\
&3,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,3,3,2,3,3,3,2,\dots
\end{align*}
has the property that, if one forms a second sequence that records the
number of 3's between successive 2's, the result is identical to the
given sequence. Show that there exists a real number $r$ such that, for
any $n$, the $n$th term of the sequence is 2 if and only if $n = 1 +
\lfloor rm \rfloor$ for some nonnegative integer $m$. (Note: $\lfloor x
\rfloor$ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to $x$.)
