The horizontal line $y=c$ intersects the curve $y = 2x - 3x^3$
in the first quadrant as in the figure. Find $c$ so that the areas of the
two shaded regions are equal. [Figure not included. The first region is
bounded by the $y$-axis, the line $y=c$ and the curve; the other lies
under the curve and above the line $y=c$ between their two points of
intersection.]
