Consider the following game played with a deck of $2n$ cards numbered
from 1 to $2n$. The deck is randomly shuffled and $n$ cards are dealt to
each of two players. Beginning with $A$, the players take turns
discarding one of their remaining cards and announcing its number. The
game ends as soon as the sum of the numbers on the discarded cards is
divisible by $2n+1$. The last person to discard wins the game. Assuming
optimal strategy by both $A$ and $B$, what is the probability that $A$ wins?
