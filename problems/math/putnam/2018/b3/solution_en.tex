The answers are $\boxed{4,16,65536,2^{256}}$.

\begin{solutionlemma}
Let $x,y$ be positive integers. Then $2^x-1\mid 2^y-1$ if and only if $x\mid y$.
\end{solutionlemma}
\begin{lemmaproof}
If $x\mid y$ then let $y=dx$ for some integer $d$. Then \[2^y-1=2^{dx}-1=\left(2^x-1\right)\left(2^{\left(d-1\right)x}+2^{\left(d-2\right)x}+\ldots+2+1\right),\] so $2^x-1\mid 2^y-1$.

If $x\nmid y$ then let $y=dx+r$ for some integers $d,r$ such that $0<r<x$ (division algorithm). From the above, $2^x-1\mid2^{dx}-1$. Suppose that $2^x-1\mid2^y-1$. Then $2^x-1\mid2^y-2^{dx}=2^{dx}\left(2^r-1\right)$ so $2^x-1\mid2^r-1$ since $2^x-1$ is odd. But $x>r$ and thus $2^x-1>2^r-1>0$, contradiction. Thus $2^x-1\nmid2^y-1$.
\end{lemmaproof}

Ignore the restriction $n<10^{100}$. I claim that the answers would be $2^{2^{2^c}}$ for some non-negative integer $c$.

First we show that these numbers work. Clearly \[2^{2^{2^c}}\mid2^{2^{2^{2^c}}}.\] Now, \[2^{2^{2^c}}-1\mid2^{2^{2^{2^c}}}-1\] because \[2^{2^c}\mid2^{2^{2^c}}.\] Finally, \[2^{2^{2^c}}-2\mid2^{2^{2^{2^c}}}-2\] because this is equivalent to \[2^{2^{2^c}-1}-1\mid2^{2^{2^{2^c}}-1}-1\] which is equivalent to \[2^{2^c}-1\mid2^{2^{2^c}}-1\] which is equivalent to \[2^c\mid2^{2^c}.\] Thus $n=2^{2^{2^c}}$ works.

Now, suppose that $n$ works. Since $n\mid 2^n$, $n=2^a$ for some non-negative integer $a$. Then \[2^a-1\mid2^{2^a}-1,\] so $a\mid2^a$ and hence $a=2^b$ for some non-negative integer $b$ (so $n=2^{2^b}$. Then \[2^{2^b}-2\mid2^{2^{2^b}}-2,\] so \[2^{2^b-1}-1\mid2^{2^{2^b}-1}-1\] and hence \[2^b-1\mid2^{2^b}-1\] so $b\mid2^b$ thus $b=2^c$ for some non-negative integer $c$. So $n=2^{2^{2^c}}$ for some non-negative integer $c$.

Now, apply the restriction $n<10^{100}$. I claim that the valid $c$ are $c=0,1,2,3$. Note that \[2^{2^{2^3}}=2^{256}=8^{85\frac{1}{3}}<10^{100}\] but \[2^{2^{2^4}}=2^{65536}=16^{16384}>10^{100}\] so this is true. Thus the answers are $2^{2^{2^0}}=4$, $2^{2^{2^1}}=16$, $2^{2^{2^2}}=65536$, and $2^{2^{2^3}}=2^{256}$ as desired.
