Suppose that $A,B,C,$ and $D$ are distinct points, no three of which lie on a line,
in the Euclidean plane. Show
that if the squares of the lengths of the line segments $AB$, $AC$, $AD$, $BC$, $BD$, and $CD$
are rational numbers, then
the quotient
\[
\frac{\mathrm{area}(\triangle ABC)}{\mathrm{area}(\triangle ABD)}
\]
is a rational number.
