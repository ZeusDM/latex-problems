Suppose that $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are distinct points, no three of which lie on a line, in the Euclidean plane. Show that if the squares of the lengths of the line segments $AB$, $AC$, $AD$, $BC$, $BD$, and $CD$ are rational numbers, then the quotient \[\frac{\mathrm{area}\left(\triangle{ABC}\right)}{\mathrm{area}\left(\triangle{ABD}\right)}\] is a rational number.
