Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers with $\gcd\left(m,n\right)=1$, and let \[a_k=\left\lfloor\frac{mk}{n}\right\rfloor-\left\lfloor\frac{m\left(k-1\right)}{n}\right\rfloor\] for $k=1,2,\ldots,n$. Suppose that $g$ and $h$ are elements in a group $G$ and that \[gh^{a_1}gh^{a_2}\cdots gh^{a_n}=e,\] where $e$ is the identity element. Show that $gh=hg$. (As usual, $\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.)
