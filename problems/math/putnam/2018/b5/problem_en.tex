Let $f=\left(f_1,f_2\right)$ be a function from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$ with continuous partial derivatives $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}$ that are positive everywhere. Suppose that \[\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_2}-\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2}+\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1}\right)^2>0\] everywhere. Prove that $f$ is one-to-one.
