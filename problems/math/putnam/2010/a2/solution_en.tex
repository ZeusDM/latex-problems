The answer is all linear functions. They clearly work by the definition of slope and derivative.

Note that $f'$ is differentiable as it is the difference of two differentiable functions $f(x+1)$ and $f(x)$. So
\begin{align*}
	f''(x)&=f'(x+1)-f'(x)\\
	&=f(x+2)-f(x+1)-f(x+1)+f(x)\\
	&=[2f'(x)+f(x)]-2[f'(x)+f(x)]+f(x)\\
	&=0
\end{align*}
so $f$ is linear.
