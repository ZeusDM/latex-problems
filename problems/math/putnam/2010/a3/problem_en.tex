Suppose that the function $h:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ has continuous partial derivatives and satisfies the equation
\[h(x,y)=a\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}(x,y)+b\frac{\partial h}{\partial y}(x,y)\]
for some constants $a,b.$ Prove that if there is a constant $M$ such that $|h(x,y)|\le M$ for all $(x,y)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2,$ then $h$ is identically zero.
