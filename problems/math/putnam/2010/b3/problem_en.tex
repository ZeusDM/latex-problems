There are 2010 boxes labeled $B_1,B_2,\dots,B_{2010},$ and $2010n$ balls have been distributed among them, for some positive integer $n.$ You may redistribute the balls by a sequence of moves, each of which consists of choosing an $i$ and moving \textit{exactly} $i$ balls from box $B_i$ into any one other box. For which values of $n$ is it possible to reach the distribution with exactly $n$ balls in each box, regardless of the initial distribution of balls?
