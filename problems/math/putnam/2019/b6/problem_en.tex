Let $\mathbb{Z}^n$ be the integer lattice in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Two points in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ are called {\em neighbors} if they differ by exactly 1 in one coordinate and are equal in all other coordinates. For which integers $n \geq 1$ does there exist a set of points $S \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ satisfying the following two conditions?
(1) If $p$ is in $S$, then none of the neighbors of $p$ is in $S$.
(2) If $p \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ is not in $S$, then exactly one of the neighbors of $p$ is in $S$.
