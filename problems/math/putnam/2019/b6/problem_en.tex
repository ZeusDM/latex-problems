Let $\mathbb{Z}^n$ be the integer lattice in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Two points in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ are called 
\emph{neighbors} if they differ by exactly $1$ in one coordinate and are equal in all other coordinates. 
For which integers $n \geq 1$ does there exist a set of points $S \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ satisfying the following two conditions?
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] If $p$ is in $S$, then none of the neighbors of $p$ is in $S$.
\item[(2)] If $p \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ is not in $S$, then exactly one of the neighbors of $p$ is in $S$.
\end{enumerate}
