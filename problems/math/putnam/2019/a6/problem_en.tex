Let $g$ be a real-valued function that is continuous on the closed interval $[0,1]$ and twice differentiable on 
the open interval $(0,1)$. Suppose that for some real number $r>1$, 
\[
\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{g(x)}{x^r} = 0.
\]
Prove that either
\[
\lim_{x \to 0^+} g'(x) = 0 \qquad \mbox{or} \qquad \limsup_{x \to 0^+} x^r |g''(x)| = \infty.
\]
