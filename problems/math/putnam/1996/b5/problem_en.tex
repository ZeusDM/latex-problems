Given a finite string $S$ of symbols $X$ and $O$, we write $\Delta(S)$
for the number of $X$'s in $S$ minus the number of $O$'s. For example,
$\Delta(XOOXOOX) = -1$. We call a string $S$ \textbf{balanced} if every
substring $T$ of (consecutive symbols of) $S$ has $-2 \leq \Delta(T)
\leq 2$. Thus, $XOOXOOX$ is not balanced, since it contains the
substring $OOXOO$. Find, with proof, the number of balanced strings of
length $n$.
