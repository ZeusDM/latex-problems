Let $f: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function for which there exists a constant $K>0$
such that $\left| f(x) - f(y) \right| \leq K \left| x - y \right|$ for all $x,y \in [0,1]$.
Suppose also that for each rational number $r \in [0,1]$, there exist integers $a$ and $b$
such that $f(r) = a + br$. Prove that there exist finitely many intervals $I_1, \dots, I_n$
such that $f$ is a linear function on each $I_i$ and $[0,1] = \bigcup_{i=1}^n I_i$.
