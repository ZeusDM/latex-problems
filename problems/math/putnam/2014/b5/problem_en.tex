In the 75th Annual Putnam Games, participants compete at mathematical games. Patniss and Keeta play a game in which they take turns choosing an element from the group of invertible $n\times n$ matrices with entries in the field $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ of integers modulo $p,$ where $n$ is a fixed positive integer and $p$ is a fixed prime number. The rules of the game are:

(1) A player cannot choose an element that has been chosen by either player on any previous turn.

(2) A player can only choose an element that commutes with all previously chosen elements.

(3) A player who cannot choose an element on his/her turn loses the game.

Patniss takes the first turn. Which player has a winning strategy?
