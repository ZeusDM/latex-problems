In the 75th annual Putnam Games, participants compete at mathematical games.
Patniss and Keeta play a game in which they take turns choosing an element 
from the group of invertible $n \times n$ matrices with entries in the field
$\mathbb{Z}/p \mathbb{Z}$ of integers modulo $p$, where $n$ is a fixed positive integer and $p$ is a fixed prime number. The rules of the game are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]
A player cannot choose an element that has been chosen by either player on any previous turn.
\item[(2)]
A player can only choose an element that commutes with all previously chosen elements.
\item[(3)]
A player who cannot choose an element on his/her turn loses the game.
\end{enumerate}
Patniss takes the first turn. Which player has a winning strategy?
(Your answer may depend on $n$ and $p$.)
