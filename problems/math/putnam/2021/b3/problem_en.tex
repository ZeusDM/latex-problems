Let $h(x,y)$ be a real-valued function that is twice continuously differentiable throughout $\mathbb{R}^2$, and define
\[
\rho(x,y) = yh_x - xh_y.
\]
Prove or disprove: For any positive constants $d$ and $r$ with $d>r$, there is a circle $\mathcal{S}$ of radius $r$ whose center is a distance $d$ away from the origin such that the integral of $\rho$ over the interior of $\mathcal{S}$ is zero.
