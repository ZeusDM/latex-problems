A grasshopper starts at the origin in the coordinate plane and makes a sequence of hops.
Each hop has length $5$, and after each hop the grasshopper is at a point whose coordinates are both integers; thus, there are $12$ possible locations for the grasshopper after the first hop.
What is the smallest number of hops needed for the grasshopper to reach the point $(2021, 2021)$?
