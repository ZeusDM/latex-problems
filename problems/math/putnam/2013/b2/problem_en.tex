Let $C=\bigcup_{N=1}^{\infty}C_N,$ where $C_N$ denotes the set of 'cosine polynomials' of the form \[f(x)=1+\sum_{n=1}^Na_n\cos(2\pi nx)\] for which:

(i) $f(x)\ge 0$ for all real $x,$ and
(ii) $a_n=0$ whenever $n$ is a multiple of $3.$

Determine the maximum value of  $f(0)$ as $f$ ranges through $C,$ and prove that this maximum is attained.
