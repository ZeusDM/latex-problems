Let $C = \bigcup_{N=1}^\infty C_N$, where $C_N$ denotes the set of those `cosine polynomials' of the form
\[
f(x) = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^N a_n \cos(2 \pi n x)
\]
for which:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)]
$f(x) \geq 0$ for all real $x$, and
\item[(ii)]
$a_n = 0$ whenever $n$ is a multiple of $3$.
\end{enumerate}
Determine the maximum value of $f(0)$ as $f$ ranges through $C$, and 
prove that this maximum is attained.
