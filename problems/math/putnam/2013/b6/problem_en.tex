Let $n\ge 1$ be an odd integer. Alice and Bob play the following game, taking alternating turns, with Alice playing first. The playing area consists of $n$ spaces, arranged in a line. Initially all spaces are empty. At each turn, a player either

• places a stone in an empty space, or
• removes a stone from a nonempty space $s,$ places a stone in the nearest empty space to the left of $s$ (if such a space exists), and places a stone in the nearest empty space to the right of $s$ (if such a space exists).

Furthermore, a move is permitted only if the resulting position has not occurred previously in the game. A player loses if he or she is unable to move. Assuming that both players play optimally throughout the game, what moves may Alice make on her first turn?
