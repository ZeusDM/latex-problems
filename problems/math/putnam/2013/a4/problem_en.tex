A finite collection of digits $0$ and $1$ is written around a circle. An \textit{arc} of length $L\ge 0$ consists of $L$ consecutive digits around the circle. For each arc $w,$ let $Z(w)$ and $N(w)$ denote the number of $0$'s in $w$ and the number of $1$'s in $w,$ respectively. Assume that $|Z(w)-Z(w')|\le 1$ for any two arcs $w,w'$ of the same length. Suppose that some arcs $w_1,\dots,w_k$ have the property that \[Z=\frac1k\sum_{j=1}^kZ(w_j)\text{ and }N=\frac1k\sum_{j=1}^k N(w_j)\] are both integers. Prove that there exists an arc $w$ with $Z(w)=Z$ and $N(w)=N.$
