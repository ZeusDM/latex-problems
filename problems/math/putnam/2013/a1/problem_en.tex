Recall that a regular icosahedron is a convex polyhedron having 12 vertices and 20 faces; the faces are congruent equilateral triangles. On each face of a regular icosahedron is written a nonnegative integer such that the sum of all $20$ integers is $39.$ Show that there are two faces that share a vertex and have the same integer written on them.
