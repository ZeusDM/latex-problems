Let $S$ be the set of all positive integers that are \textit{not} perfect squares. For $n$ in $S,$ consider choices of integers $a_1,a_2,\dots, a_r$ such that $n<a_1<a_2<\cdots<a_r$ and $n\cdot a_1\cdot a_2\cdots a_r$ is a perfect square, and let $f(n)$ be the minimum of $a_r$ over all such choices. For example, $2\cdot 3\cdot 6$ is a perfect square, while $2\cdot 3,2\cdot 4, 2\cdot 5, 2\cdot 3\cdot 4,$ $2\cdot 3\cdot 5, 2\cdot 4\cdot 5,$ and $2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5$ are not, and so $f(2)=6.$ Show that the function $f$ from $S$ to the integers is one-to-one.
