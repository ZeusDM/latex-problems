Let $n$ be a positive integer, $n \ge
2$, and put  $\theta = 2 \pi / n$.
Define points $P_k = (k,0)$ in the $xy$-plane, for $k = 1, 2
, \dots, n$.
Let $R_k$ be the map that rotates the plane counterclockwise by the
angle $\theta$ about the point $P_k$.  Let $R$ denote the map obtained
by applying, in order, $R_1$,  then $R_2, \dots$,
then $R_n$.
For an arbitrary point $(x,y)$, find, and simplify, the coordinates
of $R(x,y)$.
