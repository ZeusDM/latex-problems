Show that for any positive integer $n$ there is an integer $N$ such that the product $x_1x_2\cdots x_n$ can be expressed identically in the form
\[x_1x_2\cdots x_n=\sum_{i=1}^Nc_i(a_{i1}x_1+a_{i2}x_2+\cdots +a_{in}x_n)^n\]
where the $c_i$ are rational numbers and each $a_{ij}$ is one of the numbers, $-1,0,1.$
