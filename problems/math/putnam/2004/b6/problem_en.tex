Let $A$ be a nonempty set of positive integers, and let $N(x)$ denote the number of elements of $A$ not exceeding $x$. Let $B$ denote the set of positive integers $b$ that can be written in the form $b=a-a^{\prime}$ with $a\in A$ and $a^{\prime}\in A$. Let $b_1<b_2<\cdots$ be the members of $B$, listed in increasing order. Show that if the sequence $b_{i+1}-b_i$ is unbounded, then $\lim_{x\to \infty}\frac{N(x)}{x}=0$.
