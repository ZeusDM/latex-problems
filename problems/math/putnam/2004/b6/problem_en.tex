Let $\mathcal{A}$
be a non-empty set of positive integers, and let $N(x)$ denote
the number of elements of $\mathcal{A}$ not exceeding $x$.
Let $\mathcal{B}$ denote the set
of positive integers $b$ that can be written in the form $b = a - a'$ with
$a \in \mathcal{A}$  and $a' \in  \mathcal{A}$. Let $b_1 < b_2 < \cdots$
be the members of $\mathcal{B}$,
listed in increasing order. Show that if the sequence $b_{i+1} - b_i$ is
unbounded, then
\[
\lim_{x \to\infty}  N(x)/x  = 0.
\]
