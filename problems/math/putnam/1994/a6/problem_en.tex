Let $f_1, \dots, f_{10}$ be bijections of the set of integers such that for
each integer $n$, there is some composition $f_{i_1} \circ f_{i_2}
\circ \cdots \circ f_{i_m}$ of these functions (allowing repetitions)
which maps 0 to $n$. Consider the set of 1024 functions
\[
\mathcal{F} = \{f_1^{e_1} \circ f_2^{e_2} \circ \cdots \circ f_{10}^{e_{10}}\},
\]
$e_i = 0$ or 1 for $1 \leq i \leq 10$. ($f_i^0$ is the identity function
and $f_i^1 = f_i$.) Show that if $A$ is any nonempty finite set of
integers, then at most 512 of the functions in $\mathcal{F}$ map $A$ to
itself.
