Prove that for every positive integer $n$, there is a sequence of integers
$a_0, a_1, \dots, a_{2009}$ with $a_0 = 0$ and $a_{2009} = n$ such that each term
after $a_0$ is either an earlier term plus $2^k$ for some nonnegative integer $k$,
or of the form $b\,\mathrm{mod}\,c$ for some earlier positive terms $b$ and $c$.
[Here $b\,\mathrm{mod}\,c$ denotes the remainder when $b$ is divided by $c$,
so $0 \leq (b\,\mathrm{mod}\,c) < c$.]
