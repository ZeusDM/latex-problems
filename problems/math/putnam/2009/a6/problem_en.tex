Let $f:[0,1]^2\to\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function on the closed unit square such that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ exist and are continuous on the interior $(0,1)^2$. Let $a=\int_0^1f(0,y)dy$, $b=\int_0^1f(1,y)dy$, $c=\int_0^1f(x,0)dx$, $d=\int_0^1f(x,1)dx$. Prove or disprove: There must be a point $(x_0,y_0)$ in $(0,1)^2$ such that \[\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)=b-a\quad\text{and}\quad\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0,y_0)=d-c.\]
