Functions $f,g,h$ are differentiable on some open interval around $0$
and satisfy the equations and initial conditions
\begin{gather*}
f' = 2f^2gh+\frac{1}{gh},\quad f(0)=1, \\
g'=fg^2h+\frac{4}{fh}, \quad g(0)=1, \\
h'=3fgh^2+\frac{1}{fg}, \quad h(0)=1.
\end{gather*}
Find an explicit formula for $f(x)$, valid in some open interval around $0$.
