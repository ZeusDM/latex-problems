The answer is $0$. In fact, $d_n=0$ for $n\geq3$.

To see this, we show that the first and third rows add up to $2\cos n$ times the second row. But this is simply because \[\cos k+\cos(2n+k)=2\cos n\cdot\cos(n+k)\] by the sum-to-product identity. Then by row operations, we have $d_n=0$ for $n\geq3$.
