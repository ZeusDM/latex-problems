Let $f(t)=\sum_{j=1}^N a_j \sin(2\pi jt)$, where each $a_j$ is real
and
$a_N$ is not equal to 0.  Let $N_k$ denote the number of zeroes (including
multiplicities) of $\frac{d^k f}{dt^k}$.
Prove that
\[N_0\leq N_1\leq N_2\leq \cdots \mbox{ and } \lim_{k\to\infty} N_k =
2N.\]
[Editorial clarification: only zeroes in $[0, 1)$ should be counted.]
