Let $S_0$ be a finite set of positive integers.  We define finite
sets
$S_1,S_2,\ldots$ of positive integers as follows:
the integer $a$ is in $S_{n+1}$ if and only if exactly one of $a-1$ or $a$ is
in
$S_n$.
Show that there exist infinitely many integers $N$ for which
$S_N=S_0\cup\{N+a: a\in S_0\}$.
