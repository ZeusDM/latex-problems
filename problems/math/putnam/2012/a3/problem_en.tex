Let $f:[-1,1]\to\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function such that

(i) $f(x)=\frac{2-x^2}{2}f\left(\frac{x^2}{2-x^2}\right)$ for every $x$ in $[-1,1],$

(ii) $ f(0)=1,$ and

(iii) $\lim_{x\to 1^-}\frac{f(x)}{\sqrt{1-x}}$ exists and is finite.

Prove that $f$ is unique, and express $f(x)$ in closed form.
