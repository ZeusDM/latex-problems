Let $\mathbb{F}_p$ denote the field of integers modulo a prime $p$, and let $n$ be a positive integer. Let $v$ be a fixed vector in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, let $M$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with entries of $\mathbb{F}_p$, and define $G:\mathbb{F}_p^n\to\mathbb{F}_p^n$ by $G(x)=v+Mx$. Let $G^{(k)}$ denote the $k$-fold composition of $G$ with itself, that is, $G^{(1)}(x)=G(x)$ and $G^{(k+1)}(x)=G(G^{(k)}(x))$. Determine all pairs $p,n$ for which there exist $v$ and $M$ such that the $p^n$ vectors $G^{(k)}(0)$, $k=1,2,\ldots,p^n$ are distinct.
