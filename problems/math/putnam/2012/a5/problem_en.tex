Let $\FF_p$ denote the field of integers modulo a prime $p$, and let $n$ be a positive integer.
Let $v$ be a fixed vector in $\FF_p^n$, let $M$ be an $n \times n$ matrix with entries of $\FF_p$,
and define $G: \FF_p^n \to \FF_p^n$ by $G(x) = v + Mx$. Let $G^{(k)}$ denote the $k$-fold
composition of $G$ with itself, that is, $G^{(1)}(x) = G(x)$ and $G^{(k+1)}(x) = G(G^{(k)}(x))$.
Determine all pairs $p, n$ for which there exist $v$ and $M$ such that the $p^n$ vectors
$G^{(k)}(0)$, $k=1,2,\dots,p^n$ are distinct.
