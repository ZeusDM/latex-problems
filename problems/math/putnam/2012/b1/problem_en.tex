Let $S$ be a class of functions from $[0,\infty)$ to $[0,\infty)$ that satisfies:

(i) The functions $f_1(x)=e^x-1$ and $f_2(x)=\ln(x+1)$ are in $S;$

(ii) If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are in $S,$ the functions $f(x)+g(x)$ and $f(g(x))$ are in $S;$

(iii) If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are in $S$ and $f(x)\ge g(x)$ for all $x\ge 0,$ then the function $f(x)-g(x)$ is in $S.$

Prove that if $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are in $S,$ then the function $f(x)g(x)$ is also in $S.$
