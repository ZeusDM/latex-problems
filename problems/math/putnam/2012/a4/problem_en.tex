Let $q$ and $r$ be integers with $q>0$, and let $A$ and $B$ be intervals on the real line. Let $T$ be the set of all $b+mq$ where $b$ and $m$ are integers with $b$ in $B$, and let $S$ be the set of all integers $a$ in $A$ such that $ra$ is in $T$. Show that if the product of the lengths of $A$ and $B$ is less than $q$, then $S$ is the intersection of $A$ with some arithmetic progression.
