A round-robin tournament of $2n$ teams lasted for $2n-1$ days, as follows.
On each day, every team played one game against another team, with one team winning
and one team losing in each of the $n$ games. Over the course of the tournament,
each team played every other team exactly once. Can one necessarily choose
one winning team from each day without choosing any team more than once?
