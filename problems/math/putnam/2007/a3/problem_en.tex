Let $k$ be a positive integer. Suppose that the integers $1, 2, 3,
\dots, 3k+1$ are written down in random order. What is the probability
that at no time during this process, the sum of the integers that have
been written up to that time is a positive integer divisible by 3? Your
answer should be in closed form, but may include factorials.
