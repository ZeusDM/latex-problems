A \emph{triangulation} $\mathcal{T}$ of a polygon $P$ is a finite
collection of triangles whose union is $P$, and such that the
intersection of any two triangles is either empty, or a shared vertex,
or a shared side. Moreover, each side is a side of exactly one triangle
in $\mathcal{T}$. Say that $\mathcal{T}$ is \emph{admissible} if every
internal vertex is shared by 6 or more triangles. For example, [figure
omitted.] Prove that there is an integer $M_n$, depending only on $n$,
such that any admissible triangulation of a polygon $P$ with $n$ sides
has at most $M_n$ triangles.
