Alice and Bob play a game in which they take turns removing stones from
a heap that initially has $n$ stones. The number of stones removed at
each turn must be one less than a prime number. The winner is the player
who takes the last stone. Alice plays first. Prove that there are
infinitely many $n$ such that Bob has a winning strategy.
(For example, if $n=17$, then Alice might take 6 leaving 11; then
Bob might take 1 leaving 10; then Alice can take the remaining stones
to win.)
