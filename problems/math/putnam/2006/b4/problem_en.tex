Let $Z$ denote the set of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose coordinates are 0
or 1. (Thus $Z$ has $2^n$ elements, which are the vertices of a unit
hypercube in $\mathbb{R}^n$.) Given a vector subspace $V$
of $\mathbb{R}^n$, let $Z(V)$
denote the number of members of $Z$ that lie in $V$. Let $k$ be given,
$0 \leq k \leq n$. Find the maximum, over all vector subspaces $V
\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of dimension $k$, of the number of points in
$V \cap Z$. [Editorial note: the proposers probably intended to write
$Z(V)$ instead of
``the number of points in $V \cap Z$'', but this changes nothing.]
