Let $S$ be a finite set of points in the plane. A linear partition of $S$
is an unordered pair $\{A,B\}$ of subsets of $S$ such that $A \cup B = S$,
$A \cap B = \emptyset$, and $A$ and $B$ lie on opposite sides of some
straight line disjoint from $S$ ($A$ or $B$ may be empty). Let $L_S$ be the
number of linear partitions of $S$. For each positive integer $n$, find the
maximum of $L_S$ over all sets $S$ of $n$ points.
