Let $n$ be an even positive integer.  Write the numbers
$1,2,\ldots,n^2$ in the squares of an $n\times n$ grid so that the
$k$-th row, from left to right, is
\[(k-1)n+1,(k-1)n+2,\ldots, (k-1)n+n.\]
Color the squares of the grid so that half of the squares in each
row and in each column are red and the other half are black (a
checkerboard coloring is one possibility).  Prove that for each
coloring, the sum of the numbers on the red squares is equal to
the sum of the numbers on the black squares.
