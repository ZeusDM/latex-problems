Let $G$ be a finite group of order $n$ generated by $a$ and
$b$. Prove or disprove: there is a sequence
\[
g_1, g_2, g_3, \dots, g_{2n}
\]
such that
\begin{itemize}
   \item[(1)] every element of $G$ occurs exactly twice, and
   \item[(2)] $g_{i+1}$ equals $g_i a$ or $g_i b$ for $i = 1, 2, \dots,
   2n$. (Interpret $g_{2n+1}$ as $g_1$.)
\end{itemize}
