Let $\mathcal F$ be a finite collection of open discs in $\mathbb R^2$
whose union contains a set $E\subseteq \mathbb R^2$.  Show that there
is a pairwise disjoint subcollection $D_1,\ldots, D_n$ in $\mathcal F$
such that
\[E\subseteq \cup_{j=1}^n 3D_j.\]
Here, if $D$ is the disc of radius $r$ and center $P$, then $3D$ is the
disc of radius $3r$ and center $P$.
