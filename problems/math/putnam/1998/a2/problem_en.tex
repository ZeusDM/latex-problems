Let $s$ be any arc of the unit circle lying entirely in the first
quadrant.  Let $A$ be the area of the region lying below $s$ and
above the $x$-axis and let $B$ be the area of the region lying to the
right of the $y$-axis and to the left of $s$.  Prove that $A+B$ depends
only on the arc length, and not on the position, of $s$.
