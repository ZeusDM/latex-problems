let $H$ be the unit hemisphere $\{(x,y,z):x^2+y^2+z^2=1,z\geq 0\}$, $C$
the unit circle $\{(x,y,0):x^2+y^2=1\}$, and $P$ the regular pentagon
inscribed in $C$.  Determine the surface area of that portion of $H$ lying
over the planar region inside $P$, and write your answer in the form
$A \sin\alpha + B \cos\beta$, where $A,B,\alpha,\beta$ are real numbers.
