A not uncommon calculus mistake is to believe that the product rule
for derivatives says that $(fg)' = f'g'$. If $f(x)=e^{x^2}$,
determine, with proof, whether there exists an open interval $(a,b)$
and a nonzero function $g$ defined on $(a,b)$ such that this wrong
product rule is true for $x$ in $(a,b)$.
