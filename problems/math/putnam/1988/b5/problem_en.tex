For positive integers $n$, let $M_n$ be the $2n+1$ by $2n+1$
skew-symmetric matrix for which each entry in the first $n$
subdiagonals below the main diagonal is 1 and each of the remaining
entries below the main diagonal is -1. Find, with proof, the rank of
$M_n$. (According to one definition, the rank of a matrix is the
largest $k$ such that there is a $k \times k$ submatrix with nonzero
determinant.)

One may note that
\begin{align*}
M_1 &= \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0 & -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & -1 \\ -1 & 1 & 0
\end{array}\right) \\
M_2 &= \left( \begin{array}{ccccc} 0 & -1 & -1 & 1
& 1 \\ 1 & 0 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 0 & -1 & -1 \\ -1 & 1 & 1 & 0 &
-1 \\ -1 & -1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \end{array} \right).
\end{align*}
