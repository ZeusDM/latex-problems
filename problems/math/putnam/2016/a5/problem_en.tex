Suppose that $G$ is a finite group generated by the two elements $g$ and $h$, where the order of $g$ is odd. Show that every element of $G$ can be written in the form
\[
g^{m_1} h^{n_1} g^{m_2} h^{n_2} \cdots g^{m_r} h^{n_r}
\]
with $1 \leq r \leq |G|$ and $m_1, n_1, m_2, n_2, \ldots, m_r, n_r \in \{-1, 1\}$. 
(Here $|G|$ is the number of elements of $G$.)
