Suppose that $G$ is a finite group generated by the two elements $g$ and $h,$ where the order of $g$ is odd. Show that every element of $G$ can be written in the form
\[g^{m_1}h^{n_1}g^{m_2}h^{n_2}\cdots g^{m_r}h^{n_r}\]with $1\le r\le |G|$ and $m_n,n_1,m_2,n_2,\dots,m_r,n_r\in\{1,-1\}.$ (Here $|G|$ is the number of elements of $G.$)
