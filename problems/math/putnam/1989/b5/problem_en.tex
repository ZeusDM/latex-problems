Label the vertices of a trapezoid $T$ (quadrilateral with two parallel sides)
inscribed in the unit circle as $A,\,B,\,C,\,D$ so that $AB$ is parallel to
$CD$ and $A,\,B,\,C,\,D$ are in counterclockwise order. Let
$s_1,\,s_2$, and $d$ denote the lengths of the line segments
$AB,\, CD$, and $OE$, where E  is the point of intersection of the diagonals
of $T$, and $O$ is the center of the circle. Determine the least upper bound of
$\frac{s_1-s_2}{d}$ over all such $T$ for which $d\ne 0$, and describe all
cases, if any, in which it is attained.
