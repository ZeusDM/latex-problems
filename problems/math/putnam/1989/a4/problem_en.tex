If $\alpha$ is an irrational number, $0 < \alpha < 1$, is there a
finite game with an honest coin such that the probability of one player
winning the game is $\alpha$? (An honest coin is one for which the
probability of heads and the probability of tails are both $\frac12$.
A game is finite if with probability 1 it must end in a finite number of moves.)
