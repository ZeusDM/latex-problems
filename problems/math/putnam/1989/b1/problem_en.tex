A dart, thrown at random, hits a square target. Assuming that any two
parts of the target of equal area are equally likely to be hit, find
the probability that the point hit is nearer to the center than to any
edge. Express your answer in the form $\displaystyle{\frac{a\sqrt{b} + c}{d}}$,
where $a,\,b,\,c,\,d$ are integers.
