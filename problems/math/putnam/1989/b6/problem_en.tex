Let $(x_1,\,x_2,\,\ldots\,x_n)$ be a point chosen at random from the
$n$-dimensional region defined by
$0<x_1<x_2<\cdots < x_n<1.$  Let $f$ be a continuous function on
$[0,1]$ with $f(1)=0$.
Set $x_0=0$ and $x_{n+1}=1$. Show that the expected value of the
Riemann sum
\[
\sum_{i=0}^n (x_{i+1}-x_i) f(x_{i+1})
\]
is $\int_0^1 f(t)P(t)\, dt$, where $P$ is a polynomial of degree $n$,
