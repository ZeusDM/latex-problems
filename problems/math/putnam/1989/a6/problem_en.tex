Let $\alpha=1+a_1x+a_2x^2+\cdots$ be a formal power series with coefficients
in the field of two elements. Let
\[
a_n =
\begin{cases}
1 & \parbox{2in}{if every block of zeros in the binary expansion of $n$
has an even number of zeros in the block} \\[.3in]
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]
(For example, $a_{36}=1$ because $36=100100_2$ and $a_{20}=0$ because
$20=10100_2.$)
Prove that $\alpha^3+x\alpha+1=0.$
