The cells of a $8 \times 8$ table are initially white. Alice and Bob play a game. First Alice paints $n$ of the fields in red. Then Bob chooses $4$ rows and $4$

 columns from the table and paints all fields in them in black. Alice 

wins if there is at least one red field left. Find the least value of $n$ such that Alice can win the game no matter how Bob plays.
