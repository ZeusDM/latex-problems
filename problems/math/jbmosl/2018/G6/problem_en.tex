Let $XY$ be a chord of a circle $\Omega$,  with center $O$,  which is not a diameter. Let $P, Q$ be two distinct points inside the segment $XY$,  where $Q$ lies between $P$ and $X$. Let $\ell$ the perpendicular line dropped from $P$ to the diameter which passes through $Q$. Let $M$ be the intersection point of $\ell$ and  $\Omega$,  which is closer to $P$. Prove that $$ MP \cdot XY \ge 2 \cdot QX \cdot PY$$
