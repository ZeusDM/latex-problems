Let $ABC$ be a right angled triangle with $\angle A = 90^o$ and $AD$ its altitude. We draw parallel lines from $D$ to the vertical sides of the triangle and we call $E, Z$ their points of intersection with $AB$ and $AC$ respectively. The parallel line from $C$ to $EZ$ intersects the line $AB$ at the point $N$. Let $A' $ be the symmetric of $A$ with respect to the line $EZ$ and $I, K$ the projections of $A'$ onto $AB$ and $AC$ respectively. If $T$ is the point of intersection of the lines $IK$ and $DE$,  prove that $\angle NA'T = \angle  ADT$.
