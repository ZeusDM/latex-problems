Let ${c\equiv c\left(O, R\right)}$ be a circle with center ${O}$ and radius ${R}$ and ${A, B}$ be two points on it, not belonging to the same diameter. The bisector of angle${\angle{ABO}}$ intersects the circle ${c}$ at point ${C}$, the circumcircle of the triangle $AOB$ , say ${c_1}$ at point ${K}$ and the circumcircle of the triangle $AOC$ , say ${{c}_{2}}$ at point ${L}$. Prove that point ${K}$ is the circumcircle of the triangle $AOC$ and that point ${L}$ is the incenter of the triangle $AOB$.
