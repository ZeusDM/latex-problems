Given are two points $B,C$. Consider point $A$ not lying on the line $BC$ and draw the circles $C_1(K_1,R_1)$ (with center $K_1$ and radius $R_1$) and $C_2(K_2,R_2)$ with chord $AB, AC$ respectively such that their centers lie on the interior of the triangle $ABC$ and also $R_1 \cdot AC= R_2 \cdot AB$. Let $T$ be the intersection point of the two circles, different from $A$, and M be a random pointof line $AT$, prove that $TC \cdot S_{(MBT)}=TB \cdot S_{(MCT)}$
