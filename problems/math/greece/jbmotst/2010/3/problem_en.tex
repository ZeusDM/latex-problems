Given an acute and scalene triangle $ABC$ with $AB<AC$ and random line $(e)$ that passes throuh the center of the circumscribed circles $c(O,R)$. Line $(e)$, intersects sides $BC,AC,AB$ at points $A_1,B_1,C_1$ respectively (point $C_1$ lies on the extension of $AB$ towards $B$). Perpendicular from $A$ on line $(e)$ and $AA_1$ intersect circumscribed circle $c(O,R)$ at points $M$ and $A_2$ respectively. Prove that
a) points $O,A_1,A_2, M$ are consyclic
b) if $(c_2)$ is the circumcircle of triangle $(OBC_1)$ and $(c_3)$ is the circumcircle of triangle $(OCB_1)$, then circles $(c_1),(c_2)$ and $(c_3)$ have a common chord
