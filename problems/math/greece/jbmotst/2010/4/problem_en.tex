We color one of the numbers $1,...,8$ with white or black according to the following rules:
i) number $4$ gets colored white and one at lest of the following numbers gets colored black
ii) if two numbers $a,b$ are colored in a different color and $a+b\le 8$, then number $a+b$ gets colored black.
iii) if two numbers $a,b$ are colored in a different color and $a\cdot b\le 8$, then number $a\cdot b$ gets colored black.
If by those rules, all numbers get colored, find the color of each number.
