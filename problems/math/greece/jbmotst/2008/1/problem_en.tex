Given a point $A$ that lies on  circle $c(o,R)$ (with center $O$ and radius $R$). Let $(e)$ be the tangent of the circle $c$ at point $A$ and a line $(d)$ that passes through point $O$ and intersects $(e)$ at point $M$ and the circle at points $B,C$ (let $B$ lie between $O$ and $A$). If $AM = R\sqrt3$ , prove that
a) triangle $AMC$ is isosceles.
b) circumcenter of triangle  $AMC$ lies on circle $c$ .
