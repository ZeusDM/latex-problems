Let $ABCD$ be a rectangle with $AB=a >CD =b$. Given circles $(K_1,r_1) ,  (K_2,r_2)$  with $r_1<r_2$ tangent externally at point $K$ and also tangent to the sides of the rectangle, circle $(K_1,r_1)$ tangent to both $AD$ and $AB$, circle $(K_2,r_2)$ tangent to both $AB$ and $BC$. Let also the internal common tangent of those circles pass through point $D$.
(i) Express sidelengths $a$ and $b$ in terms of $r_1$ and $r_2$.
(ii) Calculate the ratios $\frac{r_1}{r_2}$ and $\frac{a}{b}$ .
(iii) Find the length of $DK$ in terms of $r_1$ and $r_2$.
