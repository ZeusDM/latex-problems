Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle A=105^o$ and $\angle C=\frac{1}{4} \angle B$.
a) Find the angles   $\angle B$ and  $\angle C$
b) Let $O$ be the center of the circumscribed circle of the triangle $ABC$ and let $BD$ be a diameter of that circle. Prove that the distance of point $C$ from the line $BD$ is equal to $\frac{BD}{4}$.
