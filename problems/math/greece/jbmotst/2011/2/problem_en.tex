On every side of  a square $ABCD$, we consider three points different (to each other).
a) Find the number of line segments defined with endpoints those points , that do not lie on sides of the square.
b) If there are no three of the previous line segments passing through the same point, find how many of the intersection points of those segmens line in the interior of the square.
