Let $ABC$ be an acute and scalene triangle with $AB<AC$, inscribed in a circle $c(O,R)$ (with center $O$ and radius $R$). Circle $c_1(A,AB)$ intersects side $BC$ at point $E$ and circle $c$ at point $F$. $EF$ intersects for the second time circle $c$ at point $D$ and side $AC$ at point $M$. $AD$ intersects $BC$ at point $K$. Circumcircle of triangle $BKD$ intersects $AB$ at point $L$ . Prove that points $K,L,M$ lie on a line parallel to $BF$.
