Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with $AB=CD$. From a random  point $P$ of it's diagonal $BD$, we draw a line parallel to $AB$ that intersects $AD$ at point $M$ and a line parallel to $CD$ that intersects $BC$ at point $N$. Prove that:
a) The sum $PM+PN$ is constant, independent of the position of $P$ on the diagonal $BD$.
b) $MN\le BD$. When the equality holds?
