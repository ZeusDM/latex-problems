Given the circle $c(O,R)$ (with center $O$ and radius $R$), one diameter $AB$ and midpoint $C$ of the arc $AB$. Consider circle $c_1(K,KO)$, where center $K$ lies on the segment $OA$, and consider the tangents $CD,CO$ from the point $C$ to  circle $c_1(K,KO)$. Line $KD$ intersects circle $c(O,R)$ at points $E$ and $Z$ (point $E$ lies on the semicircle that lies also point $C$). Lines $EC$ and $CZ$ intersects $AB$ at points $N$ and $M$ respectively. Prove that quadrilateral $EMZN$ is an isosceles trapezoid, inscribed in a circle whose center lie on circle $c(O,R)$.
