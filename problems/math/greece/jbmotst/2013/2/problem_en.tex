Consider $n$ different points lying on a circle, such that there are not three chords defined by that point that pass through the same interior point of the circle.
a) Find the value of $n$, if the numbers of triangles that are defined using $3$ of the n points is equal to $2n$
b) Find the value of $n$, if the numbers of the intersection points of the chords that are interior to the circle  is equal to $5n$.
