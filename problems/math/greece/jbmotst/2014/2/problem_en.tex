Let $ABCD$ be an inscribed quadrilateral in a circle $c(O,R)$ (of circle $O$ and radius $R$). With centers the vertices $A,B,C,D$, we consider the circles  $C_{A},C_{B},C_{C},C_{D}$ respectively, that do not intersect to each other . Circle $C_{A}$ intersects the sides of the quadrilateral at points $A_{1} , A_{2}$ ,  circle $C_{B}$ intersects the sides of the quadrilateral at points $B_{1} , B_{2}$ , circle $C_{C}$ at points $C_{1} , C_{2}$ and circle $C_{D}$ at points $C_{1} , C_{2}$ . Prove that the quadrilateral defined by lines $A_{1}A_{2} , B_{1}B_{2} , C_{1}C_{2} , D_{1}D_{2}$ is cyclic.
