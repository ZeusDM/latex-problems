a) If positive integer $N$ is a perfect cube and is not divisible by $10$, then $N=(10m+n)^2$ where $m,n \in N$ with $1\le n\le 9$
b) Find all the positive integers $N$ which are perfect cubes, are not divisible by $10$, such that the number obtained by erasing the last three digits to be also also a perfect cube.
