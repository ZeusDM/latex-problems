$4$ men stand at the entrance of a dark tunnel. Man $A$ needs $10$ minutes to pass through the tunnel, man $B$ needs $5$ minutes, man $C$ needs $2$ minutes and man $D$ needs $1$  minute. There is only one torch, that may be used from anyone that passes through the tunnel. Additionaly,  at most $2$ men can pass through at the same time using the existing torch.
Determine the smallest possible time the four men need to reach the exit of the tunnel.
