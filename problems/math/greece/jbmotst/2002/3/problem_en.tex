Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle A=60^o, AB\ne AC$ and let $AD$ be the angle bisector of $\angle A$. Line $(e)$ that is perpendicular on the angle bisector $AD$ at point $A$, intersects the extension of side $BC$ at point $E$ and also $BE=AB+AC$. Find the angles $\angle B$ and $\angle C$ of the triangle $ABC$.
