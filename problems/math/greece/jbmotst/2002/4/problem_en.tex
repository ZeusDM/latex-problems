We have $100$ cards with two sides, the \textit{even} and the \textit{odd}. In each side there are written two succesive integers, in the \textit{odd} side and odd integer and at the back in the \textit{even} side the even number that follows the odd number of the \textit{odd} side, such that all intgers from $1$ to $200$ are used.
Student $A$ randomly choses $21$ cards and sums all the numbers of boths sides and announces as their sum the number $913$.
Student $B$ randomly choses from the remaining cards $20$ cards and sums all the numbers of boths sides and announces as their sum the number $2400$.
a) Explain why student $A$ has done an error in the addition.
b) If the correct result for student $A$ is $903$, explain why also student $B$ has done an error in the addition.
