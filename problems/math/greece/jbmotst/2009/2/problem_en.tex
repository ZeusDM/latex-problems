Given convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ inscribed in circle $(O,R)$ (with center $O$ and radius $R$). With centers the vertices of the quadrilateral and radii $R$, we consider the circles $C_A(A,R), C_B(B,R), C_C(C,R), C_D(D,R)$. Circles $C_A$ and $C_B$ intersect at point $K$, circles $C_B$ and $C_C$ intersect at point $L$, circles $C_C$ and $C_D$ intersect at point $M$ and circles $C_D$ and $C_A$ intersect at point $N$ (points $K,L,M,N$ are the second common points of the circles given they all pass through point $O$). Prove that  quadrilateral $KLMN$ is a parallelogram.
