We are given a circle $c(O,R)$ and two points $A,B$ so that The circle $c_1 (A,r)$  crosses the circle $c$ at C,D  belongs to the short arc .From $B$ we consider the tangent lines $BE,BF$ to the circle $c_1$ ,in such way that $E$ lays out of the circle If $M\equiv EC\cap DF$ show that the quadrilateral $BCFM$ is cyclic.
