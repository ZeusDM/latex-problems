We are given a circle $c(O,R)$ and two points $A,B$ so that $R<AB<2R$.The circle $c_1 (A,r)$ ($0<r<R$) crosses the circle $c$ at C,D ($C$ belongs to the short arc $AB$).From $B$ we consider the tangent lines $BE,BF$ to the circle $c_1$ ,in such way that $E$ lays out of the circle $c$.If $M\equiv EC\cap DF$ show that the quadrilateral $BCFM$ is cyclic.
