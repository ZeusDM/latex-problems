A  student of the  National  Technical  University  was  reading  advanced mathematics  last summer for  37  days  according  to the following rules :
(a) He was  reading  at least  one hour  every  day.
(b) He was reading an integer  number of  hours, but not more  than 12, each day.
(c) He  had  to read at most  60  hours in total.

Prove  that there  were some  successive  days  during  which  the student was  reading  exactly 13  hours in  total.
