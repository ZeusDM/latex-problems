In a  triangle $ABC$  we have  $\angle C>10^0$ and  e  consider  point  $E$  on side  $AB$  such that  $\angle ACE=10^0,$ and point  $D$ on side $AC$  such that  $\angle DBA=15^0.$ Let  $Z\neq A$ be a point  of interection of  the  circumcircles of  the triangles  $ABD$ and rove that  $\angle ZBA>\angle ZCA.$
