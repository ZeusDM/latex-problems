Let  $OX_1 , OX_2$  be  rays in  the interior of a  convex  angle $XOY$ such that  Points  $K$  on $OX_1$  and  $L$  on  $OY_1$  are fixed so that   and  points  $B$  are  vary on rays $(OX , (OY$  respectively  such that  the area  of the pentagon  $OAKLB$  remains  constant. Prove that  the  circumcircle of the  triangle $OAB$  passes  from a  fixed  point,  other than
