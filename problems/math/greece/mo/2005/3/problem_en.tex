We know that $k$ is a positive integer and the equation \[ x^3+y^3-2y(x^2-xy+y^2)=k^2(x-y) \quad (1) \] has one solution $(x_0,y_0)$ with
$x_0,y_0\in \mathbb{Z}-\{0\}$ and  Prove that

i) the equation (1) has a finite number of solutions $(x,y)$ with $x,y\in \mathbb{Z}$ and 

ii) it is possible to find $11$ addition different solutions $(X,Y)$ of the equation (1) with $X,Y\in \mathbb{Z}-\{0\}$ and $X\neq Y$ where $X,Y$ are  functions of
