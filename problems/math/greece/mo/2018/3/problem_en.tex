Let $n,m$ be positive integers such that $n<m$ and $a_1, a_2, ..., a_m$ be different real numbers.
(a) Find all polynomials $P$ with real coefficients and degree at most $n$ such that:
$|P(a_i)-P(a_j)|=|a_i-a_j|$ for all $i,j=\{1, 2, ..., m\}$ such that $i<j$.
(b) If $n,m\ge 2$ does there exist a polynomial $Q$ with real coefficients and degree $n$ such that:
$|Q(a_i)-Q(a_j)|<|a_i-a_j|$ for all $i,j=\{1, 2, ..., m\}$ such that $i<j$
