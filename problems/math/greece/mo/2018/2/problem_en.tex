Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with $AB<AC<BC$ and $c(O,R)$ the circumscribed circle. Let $D, E$ be points in the small arcs $AC, AB$ respectively. Let $K$ be the intersection point of $BD,CE$ and $N$ the second common point of the circumscribed circles of the triangles $BKE$ and $CKD$. Prove that $A, K, N$ are collinear if and only if $K$ belongs to the symmedian of $ABC$ passing from $A$.
