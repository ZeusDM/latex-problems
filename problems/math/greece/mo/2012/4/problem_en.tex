The following isosceles trapezoid consists of equal equilateral triangles with side length   The side $A_1E$ has length $3$ while the larger base $A_1A_n$ has length   Starting from the point $A_1$ we move along the segments which are oriented to the right and up(obliquely right or left). Calculate (in terms of $n$ or not) the number of all possible paths we can follow, in order to arrive at points  if $n$ is an integer greater than
