Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $I$ its incenter. The lines $AI,BI,CI$ meet the circumcircle of $ABC$ at points $ D,E,F$, respectively. The circles with diameter $ ID,IE,IF$ meet the sides $ BC,CA, AB$ at pairs of points $ (A_1,A_2), (B_1, B_2), (C_1, C_2)$, respectively.

Prove that the six points $ A_1,A_2, B_1, B_2, C_1, C_2$ are concyclic.
