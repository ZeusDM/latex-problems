Consider a circle $K(O,r)$ and a point $A$ outside $K.$ A line $\epsilon$ different from $AO$ cuts $K$ at $B$ and $C,$ where $B$ lies between $A$ and $C.$
Now the symmetric line of $\epsilon$ with respect to axis of symmetry the  line $AO$ cuts $K$ at $E$ and $D,$ where $E$ lies between $A$ and $D.$
Show that  the diagonals of the quadrilateral $BCDE$ intersect in a fixed point.
