We define the sets $A_1,A_2,...,A_{160}$ such that $\left|A_{i} \right|=i$ for all  With the elements of these sets we create new sets $M_1,M_2,...M_n$ by the following procedure: in the first step we choose some of the sets $A_1,A_2,...,A_{160}$ and we remove from each of them the same number of elements. These elements that we removed are the elements of  In the second step we repeat the same procedure in the sets that came of the implementation of the first step and so we define  We continue similarly until there are no more elements in  thus defining the sets  Find the minimum value of
