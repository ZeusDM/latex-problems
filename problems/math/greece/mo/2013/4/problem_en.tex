Let a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in circle $c(O,R)$ and $D$ an arbitrary point on different from the midpoint).The circumscribed circle of which is  meets $c(O,R)$ at $K$ and $AB$ at The circumscribed circle of $COD$ meets $c(O,R)$ at $M$ and $AC$ at Finally, the circumscribed circle of $AEZ$ meets $c(O,R)$ at Prove that $\triangle{ABC}=\triangle{KMN}.$
