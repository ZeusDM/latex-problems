A triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in a circle of radius $R.$ Let $BD$ and $CE$ be the bisectors of the angles $B$ and $C$ respectively and let the line $DE$ meet the arc $AB$ not containing $C$ at point $K.$ Let $A_1, B_1, C_1$ be the feet of perpendiculars from $K$ to $BC, AC, AB,$ and $x, y$ be the distances from $D$ and $E$ to $BC,$ respectively.

(a) Express the lengths of $KA_1, KB_1, KC_1$ in terms of $x, y$ and the ratio $l = KD/ED.$

(b) Prove that $\frac{1}{KB}=\frac{1}{KA}+\frac{1}{KC}.$
