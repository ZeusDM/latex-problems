Consider a rectangle $ABCD$ with $AB = a$ and $AD = b.$ Let $l$ be a line through $O,$ the center of the rectangle, that cuts $AD$ in  $E$ such that  Let $M$ be any point on $l,$ interior to the rectangle.
Find the necessary and suï¬ƒcient condition on $a$ and $b$ that the four distances from M to lines $AD, AB, DC, BC$ in this order form an arithmetic progression.
