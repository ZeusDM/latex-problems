A square $ABCD$ is divided into $n^2$ equal small (fundamental) squares by drawing lines parallel to its sides.The vertices of the fundamental squares are called vertices of the grid.A rhombus is called nice when:$\bullet$ It is not a square$\bullet$ Its vertices are points of the grid$\bullet$ Its diagonals are parallel to the sides of the square $ABCD$

Find (as a function of $n$) the number of the nice rhombuses ($n$ is a positive integer greater than $2$).
