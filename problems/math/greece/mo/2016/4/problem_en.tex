A square $ABCD$ is divided into $n^2$ equal small (fundamental) squares by drawing lines parallel to its sides.The vertices of the fundamental squares are called vertices of the grid.A rhombus is called \textit{nice} when:
$\bullet$ It is not a square
$\bullet$ Its vertices are points of the grid
$\bullet$ Its diagonals are parallel to the sides of the square $ABCD$

Find (as a function of  the number of the \textit{nice} rhombuses  is a positive integer greater than .
