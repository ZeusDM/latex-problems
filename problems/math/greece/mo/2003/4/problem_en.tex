On the set $\Sigma$ of points of the plane $\Pi$ we deﬁne the operation $*$ which maps each pair $(X, Y )$ of points in $\Sigma$ to the point $Z = X * Y$ that is symmetric to $X$ with respect to $Y .$ Consider a square $ABCD$ in  Is it possible, using the points $A, B, C$ and applying the operation $*$ ﬁnitely many times, to construct the point $D?$
