Given are a circle $\mathcal{C}$ with center $K$ and radius $r,$ point  $A$ on the circle and point $R$ in its exterior. Consider a variable line $e$ through $R$ that intersects the circle at two points $B$ and $C.$  Let $H$ be the orthocenter of triangle $ABC.$

Show that there is a unique point $T$ in the plane of circle $\mathcal{C}$ such that the sum $HA^2 + HT^2$ remains constant (as $e$ varies.)
