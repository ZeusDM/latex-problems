Let $A$ be a point in the plane and $3$ lines which pass through this point divide the plane in $6$ regions.
In each region there are $5$ points. We know that no three of the $30$ points existing in these regions are collinear. Prove that there exist at least $1000$ triangles whose vertices are points of those regions such that $A$ lies either in the interior or on the side of the triangle.
