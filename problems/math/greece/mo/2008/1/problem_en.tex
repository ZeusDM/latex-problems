A computer generates all pairs of real numbers $x, y \in (0, 1)$ for which the numbers $a = x+my$ and $b = y+mx$ are both integers, where $m$ is a given positive integer. Finding one such pair $(x, y)$ takes $5$ seconds. Find $m$ if  the computer needs $595$ seconds to find all possible ordered pairs
