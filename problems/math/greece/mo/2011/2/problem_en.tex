In the Cartesian plane $Oxy$ we consider the points ${A_1}\left( {40,1} \right), {A_2}\left( {40,2} \right), \ldots , {A_{40}}\left( {40,40} \right)$ as well as the segments  A point of the Cartesian plane $Oxy$ is called "good", if its coordinates are integers and it is internal of one segment  Additionally, one of the segments $O{A_1},O{A_2},\ldots,O{A_{40}}$ is called "good" if  it contains a "good" point. Find the number of "good" segments and "good" points.
