We consider an acute angled triangle $ABC$ (with  and its circumcircle with center $O$ and semidiametre .The altitude $AD$ cuts the circumcircle at the point $E$ ,while the perpedicular bisector $(m)$ of the segment cuts $AD$ at the point  cuts $AC$ at the point $M$ and the circumcircle $c(O,R)$ at the point Finally $EN$ cuts the perpedicular bisector $(m)$ at the point Prove that:
\[ MZ \perp BC \iff \left(CA=CB \;\; \text{or} \;\; Z\equiv O \right) \]
