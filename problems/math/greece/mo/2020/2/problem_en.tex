Given a line segment $AB$ and a point $C$ lies inside it such that $AB=3 \cdot AC$ . Construct a parallelogram $ACDE$ such that $AC=DE=CE>AR$. Let $Z$ be a point on $AC$ such that $\angle AEZ=\angle ACE =\omega$. Prove that the line passing through point $B$ and perpendicular on side $EC$, and the line passing through point $D$  and perpendicular on side $AB$, intersect on point , let it be $K$, lying on line $EZ$.
