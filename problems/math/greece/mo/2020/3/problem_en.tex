On the board there are written in a row, the integers from $1$ until $2030$ (included that) in an increasing order.
We have the right of  ''movement'' $K$:
\textit{We choose any two numbers  that are written in consecutive positions and we replace the pair  by the number .}
We repeat the movement $K$, many times until only one number remains written on the board. Determine whether it would be possible, that number to be:
(i) $2020^{2020}$  (ii)$2021^{2020}$
