Given is the equation $x^2+y^2-axy+2=0$ where $a$ is a positive integral parameter.

how that,for $a\neq 4$ there exist no pairs $(x,y)$ of positive integers satisfying the equation.

$ii.$ Show that,for $a=4$ there exist infinite pairs $(x,y)$ of positive integers satisfying the equation,and determine those pairs.
