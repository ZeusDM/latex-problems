Let $\Gamma$ be a circle and let $d$ be a line such that $\Gamma$ and $d$ have no common points. Further, let $AB$ be a diameter of the circle  assume that this diameter $AB$ is perpendicular to the line  and the point $B$ is nearer to the line $d$ than the point  Let $C$ be an arbitrary point on the circle  different from the points $A$ and  Let $D$ be the point of intersection of the lines $AC$ and  One of the two tangents from the point $D$ to the circle $\Gamma$ touches this circle $\Gamma$ at a point  hereby, we assume that the points $B$ and $E$ lie in the same halfplane with respect to the line  Denote by $F$ the point of intersection of the lines $BE$ and  Let the line $AF$ intersect the circle $\Gamma$ at a point  different from 

Prove that the reflection of the point $G$ in the line $AB$ lies on the line
