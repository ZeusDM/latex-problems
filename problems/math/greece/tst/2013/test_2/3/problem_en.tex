Given is a triangle On the extensions of the side $AB$ we consider points $A_1,B_1$ such that $AB_1=BA_1$ (with $A_1$ lying closer to .On the extensions of the side $BC$ we consider points $B_4,C_4$ such that $CB_4=BC_4$ (with $B_4$ lying closer to .On the extensions of the side $AC$ we consider points $C_1,A_4$ such that $AC_1=CA_4$ (with $C_1$ lying closer to .On the segment $A_1A_4$ we consider points $A_2,A_3$ such that $A_1A_2=A_3A_4=mA_1A_4$ where Points $B_2,B_3$ and $C_2,C_3$ are defined similarly,on the segments $B_1B_4,C_1C_4$ respectively.If  $\ G\equiv BB_3\cap CC_3 \ , \ H\equiv AA_2\cap CC_3$ and prove that the diagonals $DG,EH,FI$ of the hexagon $DEFGHI$ are concurrent.
