Given are $n$ different concentric circles on the plane.Inside the disk with the smallest radius (strictly inside it),we consider two distinct points We consider $k$ distinct lines passing through $A$ and $m$ distinct lines passing through There is no line passing through both $A$ and $B$ and all the lines passing through $k$ intersect with all the lines passing through The intersections do not lie on some of the circles.Determine the maximum and the minimum number of regions formed by the lines and the circles and are inside the circles.
