Given are $N$ points on the plane such that no three of them are collinear,which are coloured red,green and black.We consider all the segments between these points and give to each segment a \textit{"value"} according to the following conditions:
\textit{i.}If at least one of the endpoints of a segment is black then the segment's \textit{"value"} is 
\textit{ii.}If the endpoints of the segment have the same colour,re or green,then the segment's \textit{"value"} is 
\textit{iii.}If the endpoints of the segment have different colours but none of them is black,then the segment's \textit{"value"} is 

Determine the minimum possible sum of the \textit{"values"} of the segments.
