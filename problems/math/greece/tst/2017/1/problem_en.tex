Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle inscribed in circle $c(O,R)$ with $AB<AC<BC$,
and $c_1$ be the inscribed circle of $ABC$ which intersects $AB, AC, BC$ at
$F, E, D$ respectivelly. Let $A', B', C'$ be points which lie on $c$ such that the quadrilaterals
$AEFA', BDFB', CDEC'$ are inscribable.
(1) Prove that $DEA'B'$ is inscribable.
(2) Prove that $DA', EB', FC'$ are concurrent.
