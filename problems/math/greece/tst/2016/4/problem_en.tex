For a finite set $A$ of positive integers, a partition of $A$ into two disjoint nonempty subsets $A_1$ and $A_2$ is $\textit{good}$ if the least common multiple of the elements in $A_1$ is equal to the greatest common divisor of the elements in  Determine the minimum value of $n$ such that there exists a set of $n$ positive integers with exactly $2015$ good partitions.
