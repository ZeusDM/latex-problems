Given is a triangle with inscribed in circle Let $D,E,Z$ be the midpoints of $BC,CA,AB$ respectively,and $K$ the foot of the altitude from At the exterior of $\triangle{ABC}$ and with the sides $AB,AC$ as diameters,we construct the semicircles $c_1,c_2$ respectively.Suppose that $P\equiv DZ\cap c_1 \ , \ S\equiv KZ\cap c_1$ and Finally,let $M$ be the intersection of the lines 

\textit{i.} Prove that the lines $PR,ST$ intersect at 

\textit{ii.} Prove that the lines $PR\cap MD$ intersect on
