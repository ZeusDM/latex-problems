Let $ABC$ be an acute,non-isosceles triangle with Let $D,E,Z$ be the midpoints of $BC,AC,AB$ respectively and segments $BK,CL$ are altitudes.In the extension of $DZ$ we take a point $M$ such that the parallel from $M$ to $KL$ crosses the extensions of $CA,BA,DE$ at $S,T,N$ respectively (we extend $CA$ to side and $BA$ to side and $DE$ to side).If the circumcirle $(c_{1})$ of $\triangle{MBD}$ crosses the line $DN$ at $R$ and the circumcirle $(c_{2})$ of $\triangle{NCD}$ crosses the line $DM$ at $P$ prove that
