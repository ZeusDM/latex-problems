In a blackboard there are $K$ circles in a row such that one of the numbers $1,...,K$ is assigned to each circle from the left to the right.
Change of situation of a circle is to write in it or erase the number which is assigned to it.At the beginning no number is written in its own circle.
For every positive divisor $d$ of $K$  we change the situation of the circles in which their assigned numbers are divisible by performing for each divisor $d$ $K$ changes of situation.
Determine the value of $K$ for which the following holds;when this procedure is applied once for all positive divisors of $K$ ,then all numbers $1,2,3,...,K$ are written in the circles they were assigned in.
