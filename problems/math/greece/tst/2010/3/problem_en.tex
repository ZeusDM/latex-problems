Let $ABC$ be a triangle its circumcenter and $R$ the radius of its circumcircle.Denote by $O_{1}$ the symmetric of $O$ with respect to  the symmetric of $O$ with respect to $AC$ and by $O_{3}$ the symmetric of $O$ with respect to 
(a)Prove that the circles   $C_{3}(O_{3},R)$ have a common point.
(b)Denote by $T$ this point.Let $l$ be an arbitary line passing through $T$ which intersects $C_{1}$ at  $C_{2}$ at $M$ and $C_{3}$ at From $K,L,M$ drop perpendiculars to $AB,BC,AC$ respectively.Prove that these perpendiculars pass through a point.
