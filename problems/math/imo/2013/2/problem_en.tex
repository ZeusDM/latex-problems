A configuration of $4027$ points in the plane is called Colombian if it consists of $2013$ red points and $2014$
 blue points, and no three of the points of the configuration are 
collinear. By drawing some lines, the plane is divided into several 
regions. An arrangement of lines is good for a Colombian configuration 
if the following two conditions are satisfied:

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\roman*)]
	\item No line passes through any point of the configuration.
	\item No region contains points of both colors.
\end{enumerate}

Find the least value of $k$ such that for any Colombian configuration of $4027$ points, there is a good arrangement of $k$ lines.
