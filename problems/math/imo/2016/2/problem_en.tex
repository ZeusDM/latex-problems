Find all integers $n$ for which each cell of $n\times n$ table can be filled with one of the letters $I$, $M$ and $O$ in such a way that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item in each row and each column, one third of the entries are $I$, one third are $M$ and one third are $O$; and
	\item in any diagonal, if the number of entries on the diagonal is a multiple of three, then one third of the entries are $I$, one third are $M$ and one third are $O$.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Note.} The rows and columns of an $n\times n$ table are each labelled $1$ to $n$ in a natural order. Thus each cell corresponds to a pair of positive integer $\left(i,j\right)$ with $1\leq i,j\leq n$. For $n>1$, the table has $4n-2$ diagonals of two types. A diagonal of first type consists all cells $\left(i,j\right)$  for which $i+j$ is a constant, and the diagonal of this second type consists all cells $\left(i,j\right)$ for which $i-j$ is constant.
