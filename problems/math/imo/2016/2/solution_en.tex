The answer is $n$ a multiple of $9$.

Assume that we can fill the grid to satisfy the problem constraints. It is obvious that $3\mid n$, so let $n=3k$.

We now consider the following: label every square of the board with the number $0$. We associate an ordered pair $\left(i,j\right)$ with each square as a coordinate system for the $i$th row and $j$th column.

Now, add $1$ to the label of a square for every one of the following events: \begin{align*}&\left(1\right)\qquad i\equiv2\pmod3\qquad\text{(this is a row)}\\&\left(2\right)\qquad j\equiv2\pmod3\qquad\text{(this is a column)}\\&\left(3\right)\qquad i+j\equiv1\pmod3\qquad\text{(this is a set of }2k-1\text{ diagonals with the condition)}\\&\left(4\right)\qquad i-j\equiv0\pmod3\qquad\text{(this is the other set of diagonals with the condition)}.\end{align*} Check that exactly one condition is satisfied for any $\left(i,j\right)$ that is not $\left(2,2\right)\pmod3$. In the case of $\left(2,2\right)\pmod3$, all four conditions are satisfied.

But now notice that each of the conditions correspond to sets in which I, M, O must be evenly distributed and the entire board must have I, M, O be evenly distributed. If we now subtract $1$ from the label of each square, we have all of the $\left(2,2\right)\pmod3$ square remaining. But then I, M, O must be evenly distributed across these, of which there are $k^2$. Then $3$ divides $k$, so $9$ divides $n$.

Now, if $9$ divides $n$, then we can just create $\frac{n^2}{81}$ copies of

and we are done.
