A set of postive integers is called \emph{fragrant} if it contains at least two elements and each of its elements has a prime factor in common with at least one of the other elements.  Let $P\left(n\right)=n^2+n+1$.  What is the least possible positive integer value of $b$ such that there exists a non-negative integer $a$ for which the set \[\left\{P\left(a+1\right),P\left(a+2\right),\ldots,P\left(a+b\right)\right\}\] is fragrant?
