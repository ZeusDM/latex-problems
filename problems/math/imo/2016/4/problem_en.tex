A set of postive integers is called fragrant
 if it contains at least two elements and each of its elements has a 
prime factor in common with at least one of the other elements.  Let $P(n)=n^2+n+1$.  What is the least possible positive integer value of $b$ such that there exists a non-negative integer $a$ for which the set $$\{P(a+1),P(a+2),\ldots,P(a+b)\}$$is fragrant?
