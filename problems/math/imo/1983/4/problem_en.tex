Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle and $\mathcal{E}$ the set of all points contained in the three segments $AB$,  $BC$,  and $CA$ (including $A$,  $B$,  and $C$).  Determine whether, for every partition of $\mathcal{E}$ into two disjoint subsets, at least one of the two subsets contains the vertices of a right-angled triangle.
