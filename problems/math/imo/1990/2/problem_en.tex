Let $ n \geq 3$ and consider a set $ E$ of $ 2n - 1$ distinct points on a circle. Suppose that exactly $ k$ of these points are to be colored black.  Such a coloring is good if there is at least one pair of black points such that the interior of one of the arcs between them contains exactly $ n$ points from $ E$.  Find the smallest value of $ k$ so that every such coloring of $ k$ points of $ E$ is good.
