Triangle $ABC$ has circumcircle $\Omega$ and circumcenter $O$. A circle $\Gamma$ with center $A$ intersects the segment $BC$ at points $D$ and $E$, such that $B$, $D$, $E$, and $C$ are all different and lie on line $BC$ in this order. Let $F$ and $G$ be the points of intersection of $\Gamma$ and $\Omega$, such that $A$, $F$, $B$, $C$, and $G$ lie on $\Omega$ in this order. Let $K$ be the second point of intersection of the circumcircle of triangle $BDF$ and the segment $AB$. Let $L$ be the second point of intersection of the circumcircle of triangle $CGE$ and the segment $CA$.

Suppose that the lines $FK$ and $GL$ are different and intersect at the point $X$. Prove that $X$ lies on the line $AO$.
