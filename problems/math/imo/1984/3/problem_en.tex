Given points $O$ and $A$ in the plane. Every point in the plane is colored with one of a finite number of colors. Given a point $X$ in the plane, the circle $C(X)$ has center $O$ and radius $OX+{\angle AOX\over OX}$,  where $\angle AOX$ is measured in radians in the range $[0,2\pi)$. Prove that we can find a point $X$,  not on $OA$,  such that its color appears on the circumference of the circle $C(X)$.
