A set of lines in the plane is in general position
 if no two are parallel and no three pass through the same point. A set 
of lines in general position cuts the plane into regions, some of which 
have finite area; we call these its finite regions.

Prove that for all sufficiently large $n$,  in any set of $n$ lines in general position it is possible to colour at least $\sqrt{n}$ lines blue in such a way that none of its finite regions has a completely blue boundary.

\rem{Results with $\sqrt{n}$ replaced by $c\sqrt{n}$ will be awarded points depending on the value of the constant $c$.}
