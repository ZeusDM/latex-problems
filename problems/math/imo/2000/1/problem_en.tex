Two circles $ G_1$ and $ G_2$ intersect at two points $ M$ and $ N$. Let $ AB$ be the line tangent to these circles at $ A$ and $ B$,  respectively, so that $ M$ lies closer to $ AB$ than $ N$. Let $ CD$ be the line parallel to $ AB$ and passing through the point $ M$,  with $ C$ on $ G_1$ and $ D$ on $ G_2$. Lines $ AC$ and $ BD$ meet at $ E$; lines $ AN$ and $ CD$ meet at $ P$; lines $ BN$ and $ CD$ meet at $ Q$. Show that $ EP = EQ$.
