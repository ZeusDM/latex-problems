A magician has one hundred cards 
numbered 1 to 100. He puts them into three boxes, a red one, a white one
 and a blue one, so that each box contains at least one card. A member 
of the audience draws two cards from two different boxes and announces 
the sum of numbers on those cards. Given this information, the magician 
locates the box from which no card has been drawn.

How many ways are there to put the cards in the three boxes so that the trick works?
