An infinite sequence $ \,x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},\ldots \,$ of real numbers is said to be bounded if there is a constant $ \,C\,$ such that $ \, \vert x_{i} \vert \leq C\,$ for every $ \,i\geq 0$. Given any real number $ \,a > 1,\,$ construct a bounded infinite sequence $ x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},\ldots \,$ such that\[ \vert x_{i} - x_{j} \vert \vert i - j \vert^{a}\geq 1\]
for every pair of distinct nonnegative integers $ i, j$.
