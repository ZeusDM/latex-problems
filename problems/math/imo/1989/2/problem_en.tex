$ ABC$ is a triangle, the bisector of angle $ A$ meets the circumcircle of triangle $ ABC$ in $ A_1$,  points $ B_1$ and $ C_1$ are defined similarly. Let $ AA_1$ meet the lines that bisect the two external angles at $ B$ and $ C$ in $ A_0$. Define $ B_0$ and $ C_0$ similarly. Prove that the area of triangle $ A_0B_0C_0 = 2 \cdot$ area of hexagon $ AC_1BA_1CB_1 \geq 4 \cdot$ area of triangle $ ABC$.
