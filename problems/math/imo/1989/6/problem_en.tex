A permutation $ \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{2n}\}$ of the set $ \{1,2, \ldots, 2n\}$ where $ n$ is a positive integer, is said to have property $ T$ if $ |x_i - x_{i + 1}| = n$ for at least one $ i$ in $ \{1,2, \ldots, 2n - 1\}.$ Show that, for each $ n$,  there are more permutations with property $ T$ than without.
