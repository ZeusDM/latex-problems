Let $ n$ be a positive integer. Consider\[ S = \left\{ (x,y,z) \mid x,y,z \in \{ 0, 1, \ldots, n\}, x + y + z > 0 \right \}
\]

as a set of $ (n + 1)^{3} - 1$ points in the three-dimensional space. Determine the smallest possible number of planes, the union of which contains $ S$ but does not include $ (0,0,0)$.
