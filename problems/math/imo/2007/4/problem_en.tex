In triangle $ ABC$ the bisector of angle $ BCA$ intersects the circumcircle again at $ R$,  the perpendicular bisector of $ BC$ at $ P$,  and the perpendicular bisector of $ AC$ at $ Q$. The midpoint of $ BC$ is $ K$ and the midpoint of $ AC$ is $ L$. Prove that the triangles $ RPK$ and $ RQL$ have the same area.
