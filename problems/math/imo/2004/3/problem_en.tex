Define a \emph{hook} to be a figure made up of six unit squares as shown below in the picture, or any of the figures obtained by applying rotations and reflections to this figure.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[x=.5cm,y=.5cm]
	\draw (0,0) -- (1,0);
	\draw (0,1) -- (1,1);
	\draw (2,1) -- (3,1);
	\draw (0,2) -- (3,2);
	\draw (0,3) -- (3,3);
	\draw (0,0) -- (0,3);
	\draw (1,0) -- (1,3);
	\draw (2,1) -- (2,3);
	\draw (3,1) -- (3,3);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Determine all $ m\times n$ rectangles that can  be covered without gaps and without overlaps with hooks such that

\begin{itemize}
	\item the rectangle is covered without gaps and without overlaps
	\item no part of a hook covers area outside the rectangle.
\end{itemize}
