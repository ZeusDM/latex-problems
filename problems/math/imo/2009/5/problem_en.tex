Determine all functions $ f$ from the set of positive integers to the set of positive integers such that, for all positive integers $ a$ and $ b$,  there exists a non-degenerate triangle\footnote{A triangle is non-degenerate if its vertices are not collinear.} with sides of lengths\[ a, f(b) \text{ and } f(b + f(a) - 1).\]
