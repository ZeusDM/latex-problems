The circle $S$ has centre $O$,  and $BC$ is a diameter of $S$. Let $A$ be a point of $S$ such that $\angle AOB<120{{}^\circ}$.  Let $D$ be the midpoint of the arc $AB$ which does not contain $C$. The line through $O$ parallel to $DA$ meets the line $AC$ at $I$. The perpendicular bisector of $OA$ meets $S$ at $E$ and at $F$. Prove that $I$ is the incentre of the triangle $CEF.$
