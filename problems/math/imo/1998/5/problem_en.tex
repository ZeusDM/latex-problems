Let $I$ be the incenter of triangle $ABC$. Let $K,L$ and $M$ be the points of tangency of the incircle of $ABC$ with $AB,BC$ and $CA$,  respectively. The line $t$ passes through $B$ and is parallel to $KL$. The lines $MK$ and $ML$ intersect $t$ at the points $R$ and $S$. Prove that $\angle RIS$ is acute.
