In an acute-angled triangle $ABC$ the interior bisector of angle $A$ meets $BC$ at $L$ and meets the circumcircle of $ABC$ again at $N$. From $L$ perpendiculars are drawn to $AB$ and $AC$,  with feet $K$ and $M$ respectively. Prove that the quadrilateral $AKNM$ and the triangle $ABC$ have equal areas.
