A set $ S$ of points from the space will be called completely symmetric if it has at least three elements and fulfills the condition that for every two distinct points $ A$ and $ B$ from $ S$,  the perpendicular bisector plane of the segment $ AB$ is a plane of symmetry for $ S$.

 Prove that if a completely symmetric set is finite, then it consists of
 the vertices of either a regular polygon, or a regular tetrahedron or a
 regular octahedron.
