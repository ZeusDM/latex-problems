Let $ A,B,C,D$ be four distinct points on a line, in that order.  The circles with diameters $ AC$ and $ BD$ intersect at $ X$ and $ Y$. The line $ XY$ meets $ BC$ at $ Z$. Let $ P$ be a point on the line $ XY$ other than $ Z$. The line $ CP$ intersects the circle with diameter $ AC$ at $ C$ and $ M$,  and the line $ BP$ intersects the circle with diameter $ BD$ at $ B$ and $ N$. Prove that the lines $ AM,DN,XY$ are concurrent.
