In triangle $ABC$, point $A_1$ lies on side $BC$ and point $B_1$ lies on side $AC$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be points on segments $AA_1$ and $BB_1$, respectively, such that $PQ$ is parallel to $AB$. Let $P_1$ be a point on line $PB_1$, such that $B_1$ lies strictly between $P$ and $P_1$, and $\angle{PP_1C}=\angle{BAC}$. Similarly, let $Q_1$ be a point on line $QA_1$, such that $A$ lies strictly between $Q$ and $Q_1$, and $\angle{CQ_1Q}=\angle{CBA}$.

Prove that points $P$, $Q$, $P_1$, and $Q_1$ are concyclic.
