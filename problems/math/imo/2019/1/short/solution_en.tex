The answers are $f(x)=0$ or $2x+c$ for any $c\in\mathbb{Z}$. It is straightforward to show that these are the only linear solutions, so we prove that all solutions are linear. But this is easily done with $(a,b)=(0,x+1)$ and $(1,x)$, which gives $f(0)+2f(x+1)=f(2)+2f(x)$, equivalently $\Delta f\equiv c$.
