A site is any point $(x, y)$ in the plane such that $x$ and $y$ are both positive integers less than or equal to 20.
Initially, each of the 400 sites is unoccupied. Amy and Ben take turns 
placing stones with Amy going first.

On her turn, Amy places a new red 
stone on an unoccupied site such that the distance between any two sites
 occupied by red stones is not equal to $\sqrt{5}$.

 On his turn, Ben places a new blue stone on any unoccupied site. (A 
site occupied by a blue stone is allowed to be at any distance from any 
other occupied site.) They stop as soon as a player cannot place a 
stone.

Find the greatest $K$ such that Amy can ensure that she places at least $K$ red stones, no matter how Ben places his blue stones.
