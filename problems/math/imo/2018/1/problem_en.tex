Let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of acute-angled triangle $ABC$. Points $D$ and $E$ lie on segments $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, such that $AD=AE$. The perpendicular bisectors of $BD$ and $CE$ intersect the minor arcs $AB$ and $AC$ of $\Gamma$ at points $F$ and $G$, respectively. Prove that the lines $DE$ and $FG$ are parallel (or are the same line).
