Let $a_1,a_2,\ldots,$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers. Suppose that there is an integer $N>1$ such that, for each $n\geq N$, the number \[\frac{a_1}{a_2}+\frac{a_2}{a_3}+\cdots+\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}+\frac{a_n}{a_1}\] is an integer. Prove that there is a positive integer $M$ such that $a_m=a_{m+1}$ for all $m\geq M$.
