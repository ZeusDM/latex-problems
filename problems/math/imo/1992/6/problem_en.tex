For each positive integer $n$, $S(n)$ is defined to be the greatest integer such that, for every positive integer $k \leq S(n),$ $n^{2}$ can be written as the sum of $k$ positive squares.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item Prove that $S(n) \leq n^{2} - 14$ for each $n \geq 4$.
	\item Find an integer $n$ such that $S(n) = n^{2} - 14$.
	\item Prove that there are infintely many integers $n$ such that $S(n) = n^{2}-14.$
\end{enumerate}
