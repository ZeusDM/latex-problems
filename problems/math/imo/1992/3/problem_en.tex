Consider $9$
 points in space, no four of which are coplanar. Each pair of points is 
joined by an edge (that is, a line segment) and each edge is either 
colored blue or red or left uncolored.

Find the smallest value of  $\,n\,$ such that whenever exactly $\,n\,$ edges are colored, the set of colored edges necessarily contains a triangle all of whose edges have the same color.
