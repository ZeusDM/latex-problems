Let $ n$ be an even positive integer. Let $ A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{n + 1}$ be sets having $ n$
 elements each such that any two of them have exactly one element in 
common while every element of their union belongs to at least two of the
 given sets.
 For which $ n$ can one assign to every element of the union one of the numbers $0$ and $1$ in such a manner that each of the sets has exactly $ \frac {n}{2}$ zeros?
