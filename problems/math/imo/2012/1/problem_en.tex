Given triangle $ABC$ the point $J$ is the centre of the excircle\footnote{The excircle of $ABC$ opposite the vertex $A$ is the circle that is tangent to the line segment $BC$,  to the ray $AB$ beyond $B$,  and to the ray $AC$ beyond $C$.} opposite the vertex $A.$ This excircle is tangent to the side $BC$ at $M$,  and to the lines $AB$ and $AC$ at $K$ and $L$,  respectively. The lines $LM$ and $BJ$ meet at $F$,  and the lines $KM$ and $CJ$ meet at $G.$ Let $S$ be the point of intersection of the lines $AF$ and $BC$,  and let $T$ be the point of intersection of the lines $AG$ and $BC.$ Prove that $M$ is the midpoint of $ST.$
