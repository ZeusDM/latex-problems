Let $S$ be a square with sides length $100$. Let $L$ be a path within $S$ which does not meet itself and which is composed of line segments $A_0A_1,A_1A_2,A_2A_3,\ldots,A_{n-1}A_n$ with $A_0=A_n$. Suppose that for every point $P$ on the boundary of $S$ there is a point of $L$ at a distance from $P$ no greater than $\frac {1} {2}$. Prove that there are two points $X$ and $Y$ of $L$ such that the distance between $X$ and $Y$ is not greater than $1$ and the length of the part of $L$ which lies between $X$ and $Y$ is not smaller than $198$.
