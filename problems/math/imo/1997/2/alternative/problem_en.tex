Four different points $ A,B,C,D$ are chosen on a circle $ \Gamma$ such that the triangle $ BCD$ is not right-angled. Prove that:

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item The perpendicular bisectors of $ AB$ and $ AC$ meet the line $ AD$ at certain points $ W$ and $ V,$ respectively, and that the lines $ CV$ and $ BW$ meet at a certain point $ T.$
	\item The length of one of the line segments $ AD, BT,$ and $ CT$ is the sum of the lengths of the other two.
\end{enumerate}
