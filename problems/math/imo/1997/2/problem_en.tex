It is known that $ \angle BAC$ is the smallest angle in the triangle $ ABC$. The points $ B$ and $ C$ divide the circumcircle of the triangle into two arcs. Let $ U$ be an interior point of the arc between $ B$ and $ C$ which does not contain $ A$. The perpendicular bisectors of $ AB$ and $ AC$ meet the line $ AU$ at $ V$ and $ W$,  respectively. The lines $ BV$ and $ CW$ meet at $ T$.

Show that $ AU = TB + TC$.
