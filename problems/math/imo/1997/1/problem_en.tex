In the plane the points with 
integer coordinates are the vertices of unit squares. The squares are 
coloured alternately black and white (as on a chessboard). For any pair 
of positive integers $ m$ and $ n$,  consider a right-angled triangle whose vertices have integer coordinates and whose legs, of lengths $ m$ and $ n$,  lie along edges of the squares. Let $ S_1$ be the total area of the black part of the triangle and $ S_2$ be the total area of the white part. Let $ f(m,n) = | S_1 - S_2 |$.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item Calculate $ f(m,n)$ for all positive integers $ m$ and $ n$ which are either both even or both odd.
	\item Prove that $ f(m,n) \leq \frac 12 \max \{m,n \}$ for all $ m$ and $ n$.
	\item Show that there is no constant $ C\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $ f(m,n) < C$ for all $ m$ and $ n$.
\end{enumerate}
