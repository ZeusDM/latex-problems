For each positive integer $ n$,  let $ f(n)$ denote the number of ways of representing $ n$
 as a sum of powers of 2 with nonnegative integer exponents. 

Representations which differ only in the ordering of their summands are 
considered to be the same.
For instance, $ f(4) = 4$,  because the number 4 can be represented in the following four ways: 4; 2+2; 2+1+1; 1+1+1+1.

Prove that, for any integer $ n \geq 3$ we have $ 2^{\frac {n^2}{4}} < f(2^n) < 2^{\frac {n^2}2}$.
