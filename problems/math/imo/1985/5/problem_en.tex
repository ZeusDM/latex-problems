A circle with center $O$ passes through the vertices $A$ and $C$ of the triangle $ABC$ and intersects the segments $AB$ and $BC$ again at distinct points $K$ and $N$ respectively. Let $M$ be the point of intersection of the circumcircles of triangles $ABC$ and $KBN$ (apart from $B$). Prove that $\angle OMB=90^{\circ}$.
