We are given a positive integer $ r$ and a rectangular board $ ABCD$ with dimensions $ AB = 20, BC = 12$. The rectangle is divided into a grid of $ 20 \times 12$ unit squares. The following moves are permitted on the board: one can move from one square to another only if the distance between the centers of the two squares is $ \sqrt {r}$. The task is to find a sequence of moves leading from the square with $ A$ as a vertex to the square with $ B$ as a vertex.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item Show that the task cannot be done if $ r$ is divisible by 2 or 3.
	\item Prove that the task is possible when $ r = 73$.
	\item Can the task be done when $ r = 97$?
\end{enumerate}
