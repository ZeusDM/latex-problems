We consider a fixed point $P$ in the interior of a fixed sphere$.$ We construct three segments $PA, PB,PC$,  perpendicular two by two$,$ with the vertexes $A, B, C$ on the sphere$.$ We consider the vertex $Q$ which is opposite to $P$ in the parallelepiped (with right angles) with $PA, PB, PC$ as edges$.$ Find the locus of the point $Q$ when $A, B, C$ take all the positions compatible with our problem.
