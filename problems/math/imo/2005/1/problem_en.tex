Six points are  chosen on the sides of an equilateral triangle $ABC$: $A_1$,  $A_2$ on $BC$,  $B_1$,  $B_2$ on $CA$ and $C_1$,  $C_2$ on $AB$,  such that they are the vertices of a convex hexagon $A_1A_2B_1B_2C_1C_2$ with equal side lengths.

Prove that the lines $A_1B_2$,  $B_1C_2$ and $C_1A_2$ are concurrent.
