Let $ABCD$ be a fixed convex quadrilateral with $BC=DA$ and $BC$ not parallel with $DA$. Let two variable points $E$ and $F$ lie of the sides $BC$ and $DA$,  respectively and satisfy $BE=DF$. The lines $AC$ and $BD$ meet at $P$,  the lines $BD$ and $EF$ meet at $Q$,  the lines $EF$ and $AC$ meet at $R$.

Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles $PQR$,  as $E$ and $F$ vary, have a common point other than $P$.
