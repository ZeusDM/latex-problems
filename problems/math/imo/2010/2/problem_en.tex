Given a triangle $ABC$,  with $I$ as its incenter and $\Gamma$ as its circumcircle, $AI$ intersects $\Gamma$ again at $D$. Let $E$ be a point on the arc $BDC$,  and $F$ a point on the segment $BC$,  such that $\angle BAF=\angle CAE < \frac{1}{2} \angle BAC$. If $G$ is the midpoint of $IF$,  prove that the meeting point of the lines $EI$ and $DG$ lies on $\Gamma$.
