Let $ ABC$ be an isosceles triangle with $ AB = AC$. $ M$ is the midpoint of $ BC$ and $ O$ is the point on the line $ AM$ such that $ OB$ is perpendicular to $ AB$. $ Q$ is an arbitrary point on $ BC$ different from $ B$ and $ C$. $ E$ lies on the line $ AB$ and $ F$ lies on the line $ AC$ such that $ E, Q, F$ are distinct and collinear. Prove that $ OQ$ is perpendicular to $ EF$ if and only if $ QE = QF$.
