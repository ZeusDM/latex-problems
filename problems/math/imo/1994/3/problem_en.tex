For any positive integer $ k$,  let $ f_k$ be the number of elements in the set $ \{ k + 1, k + 2, \ldots, 2k\}$ whose base 2 representation contains exactly three 1s.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item Prove that for any positive integer $ m$,  there exists at least one positive integer $ k$ such that $ f(k) = m$.
	\item Determine all positive integers $ m$ for which there exists exactly one $ k$ with $ f(k) = m$.
\end{enumerate}
