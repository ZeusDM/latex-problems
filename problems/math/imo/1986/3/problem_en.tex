To each vertex of a regular 
pentagon an integer is assigned, so that the sum of all five numbers is 
positive. If three consecutive vertices are assigned the numbers $x,y,z$ respectively, and $y<0$,  then the following operation is allowed: $x,y,z$ are replaced by $x+y,-y,z+y$
 respectively. Such an operation is performed repeatedly as long as at 
least one of the five numbers is negative.

Determine whether this 
procedure necessarily comes to an end after a finite number of steps.
