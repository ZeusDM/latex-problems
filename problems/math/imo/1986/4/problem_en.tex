Let $A,B$ be adjacent vertices of a regular $n$-gon ($n\ge5$) with center $O$. A triangle $XYZ$,  which is congruent to and initially coincides with $OAB$,  moves in the plane in such a way that $Y$ and $Z$ each trace out the whole boundary of the polygon, with $X$ remaining inside the polygon. Find the locus of $X$.
