Let $A$,  $B$,  $C$,  $D$ be four points in the plane, with $C$ and $D$ on the same side of the line $AB$,  such that $AC \cdot BD = AD \cdot BC$ and $\angle ADB = 90^{\circ}+\angle ACB$.

Find the ratio $\frac{AB \cdot CD}{AC \cdot BD}$, and prove that the circumcircles of the triangles $ACD$ and $BCD$
 are orthogonal.
