For three points $A,B,C$ in the plane, we define $m(ABC)$ to be the smallest length of the three heights of the triangle $ABC$,  where in the case $A$,  $B$,  $C$ are collinear, we set $m(ABC) = 0$. Let $A$,  $B$,  $C$ be given points in the plane. Prove that for any point $X$ in the plane,\[ m(ABC) \leq m(ABX) + m(AXC) + m(XBC).  \]
