On an infinite chessboard, a solitaire game is played as follows: at the start, we have $n^2$ pieces occupying a square of side $n.$

 The only allowed move is to jump over an occupied square to an 
unoccupied one, and the piece which has been jumped over is removed.

For which $n$ can the game end with only one piece remaining on the board?
