In a rectangular coordinate system we call a horizontal line parallel to the $x$ -axis triangular if it intersects the curve with equation \[y = x^4 + px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s\] in the points $A,B,C$ and $D$ (from left to right) such that the segments $AB, AC$ and $AD$ are the sides of a triangle. Prove that the lines parallel to the $x$ - axis intersecting the curve in four distinct points are all triangular or none of them is triangular.
