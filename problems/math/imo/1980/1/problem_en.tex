Let $\alpha, \beta$ and $\gamma$ denote the angles of the triangle $ABC$. The perpendicular bisector of $AB$ intersects $BC$ at the point $X$,  the perpendicular bisector of $AC$ intersects it at $Y$. Prove that $\tan(\beta) \cdot \tan(\gamma) = 3$ implies $BC= XY$. Show that this condition is not necessary, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for $BC = XY$.
