Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with $AB < AC$ and let $O$ be the centre of its circumcircle $\omega$.
Let $D$ be a point on the line segment $BC$ such that $\angle BAD = \angle CAO$.
Let $E$ be the second point of intersection of $\omega$ and the line $AD$.
If $M$, $N$ and $P$ are the midpoints of the line segments $BE$, $OD$ and $AC$, respectively, show that the points $M$, $N$ and $P$ are collinear.
