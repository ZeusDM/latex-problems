Let $n$ be a positive integer. Two players, Alice and Bob, are playing the following game:

- Alice chooses $n$ real numbers; not necessarily distinct.

- Alice writes all pairwise sums on a sheet of paper and gives it to Bob. (There are $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ such sums; not necessarily distinct.)

- Bob wins if he finds correctly the initial $n$ numbers chosen by Alice with only one guess.

Can Bob be sure to win for the following cases?

a. $n=5$

b. $n=6$

c. $n=8$

Justify your answer(s).

[For example, when $n=4$,

 Alice may choose the numbers 1, 5, 7, 9, which have the same pairwise 

sums as the numbers 2, 4, 6, 10, and hence Bob cannot be sure to win.]
