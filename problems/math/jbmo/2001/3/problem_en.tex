Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle and $D$, $E$ points on the sides $[AB]$ and $[AC]$ respectively. If $DF$, $EF$ (with $F\in AE$, $G\in AD$) are the interior angle bisectors of the angles of the triangle $ADE$, prove that the sum of the areas of the triangles $DEF$ and $DEG$ is at most equal with the area of the triangle $ABC$. When does the equality hold?Greece
