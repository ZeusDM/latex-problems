Let $D$, $E$, $F$ be the midpoints of the arcs $BC$, $CA$, $AB$ on the circumcircle of a triangle $ABC$ not containing the points $A$, $B$, $C$, respectively. Let the line $DE$ meets $BC$ and $CA$ at $G$ and $H$, and let $M$ be the midpoint of the segment $GH$. Let the line $FD$ meet $BC$ and $AB$ at $K$ and $J$, and let $N$ be the midpoint of the segment $KJ$.

a) Find the angles of triangle $DMN$;

b) Prove that if $P$ is the point of intersection of the lines $AD$ and $EF$, then the circumcenter of triangle $DMN$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $PMN$.
