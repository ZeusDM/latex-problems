Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle inscribed in a circle $k$. It is given that the tangent from $A$ to the circle meets the line $BC$ at point $P$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of the line segment $AP$ and $R$ be the second intersection point of the circle $k$ with the line $BM$. The line $PR$ meets again the circle $k$ at point $S$ different from $R$.

Prove that the lines $AP$ and $CS$ are parallel.
