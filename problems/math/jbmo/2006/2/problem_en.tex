The triangle $ABC$ is isosceles with $AB=AC$, and $\angle{BAC} < 60^{\circ}$.
The points $D$ and $E$ are chosen on the side $AC$ such that, $EB=ED$, and $\angle{ABD} \equiv \angle{CBE}$.
Denote by $O$ the intersection point between the internal bisectors of the angles $\angle{BDC}$ and $\angle{ACB}$.
Compute $\angle{COD}$.
