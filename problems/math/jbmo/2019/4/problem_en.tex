A $5 \times 100$  table is divided into $500$ unit square cells, where $n$ of them are coloured black and the rest are coloured white. Two unit square cells are called adjacent if they share a common side. Each of the unit square cells has at most two adjacent black unit square cells. Find the largest possible value of $n$.
