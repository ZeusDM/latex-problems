Triangle $ABC$ is such that $AB < AC$. The perpendicular bisector of side $BC$ intersects lines $AB$ and $AC$ at points $P$ and $Q$,  respectively. Let $H$ be the orthocentre of triangle $ABC$,  and let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of segments $BC$ and $PQ$,  respectively. Prove that lines $HM$ and $AN$ meet on the circumcircle of $ABC$.
