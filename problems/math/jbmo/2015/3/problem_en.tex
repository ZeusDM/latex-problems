Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle.The lines $l_1$ and $l_2$ are perpendicular to $AB$ at the points $A$ and $B$, respectively.The perpendicular lines from the midpoint $M$ of $AB$ to the lines $AC$ and $BC$ intersect $l_1$ and $l_2$ at the points $E$ and $F$, respectively.If $D$ is the intersection point of the lines $EF$ and $MC$, prove that \[\angle ADB = \angle EMF.\]
