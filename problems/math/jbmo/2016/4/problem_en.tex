A $5 \times 5$

 table is called regular f each of its cells contains one of four 

pairwise distinct real numbers,such that each of them occurs exactly one

 in every $2 \times 2$

 subtable.The sum of all numbers of a regular table is called the total 

sum of the table.With any four numbers,one constructs all possible 

regular tables,computes their total sums and counts the distinct 

outcomes.Determine the maximum possible count.
