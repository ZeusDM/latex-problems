A $9\times 7$ rectangle is tiled with tiles of the two types: L-shaped tiles composed by three unit squares (can be rotated repeatedly with $90^\circ$) and square tiles composed by four unit squares.

Let $n\ge 0$ be the number of the $2 \times 2 $ tiles which can be used in such a tiling. Find all the values of $n$.
