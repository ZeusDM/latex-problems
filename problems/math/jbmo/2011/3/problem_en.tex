Let $n&gt;3$ be a positive integer. Equilateral triangle ABC is divided into $n^2$ smaller congruent equilateral triangles (with sides parallel to its sides). Let $m$ be the number of rhombuses that contain two small equilateral triangles and $d$ the number of rhombuses that contain eight small equilateral triangles. Find the difference $m-d$ in terms of $n$.
