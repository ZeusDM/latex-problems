Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=AC$. Also, let $D\in[BC]$ be a point such that $BC&gt;BD&gt;DC&gt;0$, and let $\mathcal{C}_1,\mathcal{C}_2$ be the circumcircles of the triangles $ABD$ and $ADC$ respectively. Let $BB'$ and $CC'$ be diameters in the two circles, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $B'C'$. Prove that the area of the triangle $MBC$ is constant (i.e. it does not depend on the choice of the point $D$).Greece
