It is known that $BU = p - c$, $UC = p - b$, and the equivalent for the other sides, in which $a, b, c$ are the lengths of the sides of $ABC$ and $p = \tfrac{a+b+c}{2}$.

Let $P = r_u \cap r_v$, $I_C$ be the excenter relative to $C$, and $H$ be the ortocenter of $ABC$
On one hand, the perpendicular projection of the segment $PI_C$ onto the line $CB$ is $b$, and the perpendicular projection of the segment $PI_C$ onto the line $CA$ is $a$. On the other hand, the perpendicular projection of the segment $CH$ onto the line $CB$ is $b\cos C$, and the perpendicular projection of $CH$ onto the line $CA$ is $a\cos C$.

Since those form the same ratio, it follows that $AB \perp CH \parallel PI_C$, thus, $PW$ is indeed perpendicular to $AB$ and $P \in r_w$. Therefore, the lines $r_u$, $r_v$ and $r_w$ intersect at $P$.
