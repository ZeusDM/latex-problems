Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $\omega$ its circumcircle. Let $D$ and $E$ be the foot of the angle bisctors relative to $B$ and $C$, respectively. The line $DE$ meets $\omega$ at $F$ and $G$. Prove that the tangents to $\omega$ through $F$ and $G$ are tangents to the excircle of  $\triangle ABC$ opposite to $A$.
