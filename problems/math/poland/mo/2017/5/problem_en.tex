Point $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$ of a triangle $ABC$, in which $AB=AC$. Point $D$ is the orthogonal projection of $M$ on $AB$. Circle $\omega$ is inscribed in triangle $ACD$ and tangent to segments $AD$ and $AC$ at $K$ and $L$ respectively. Lines tangent to $\omega$ which pass through $M$ cross line $KL$ at $X$ and $Y$, where points $X$, $K$, $L$ and $Y$ lie on $KL$ in this specific order. Prove that points $M$, $D$, $X$ and $Y$ are concyclic.
