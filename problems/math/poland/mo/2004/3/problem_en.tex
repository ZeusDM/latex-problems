On a tournament with $ n \ge 3$ participants, every two participants played exactly one match and there were no draws. A three-element set of participants is called a \textit{draw-triple} if they can be enumerated so that the ﬁrst defeated the second, the second defeated the third, and the third defeated the ﬁrst. Determine the largest possible number of draw-triples on such a tournament.
