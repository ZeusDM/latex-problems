A point $ D$ is taken on the side $ AB$ of a triangle $ ABC$. Two circles passing through $ D$ and touching $ AC$ and $ BC$ at $ A$ and $ B$ respectively intersect again at point $ E$. Let $ F$ be the point symmetric to $ C$ with respect to the perpendicular bisector of $ AB$. Prove that the points $ D,E,F$ lie on a line.
