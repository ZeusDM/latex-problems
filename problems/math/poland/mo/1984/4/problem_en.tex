A coin is tossed $n$ times, and the outcome is written in the form ($a_1,a_2,...,a_n$), where $a_i = 1$ or $2$ depending on whether the result of the $i$-th toss is the head or the tail, respectively. Set $b_j = a_1 +a_2 +...+a_j$ for $j = 1,2,...,n$, and let $p(n)$ be the probability that the sequence $b_1,b_2,...,b_n$ contains the number $n$. Express $p(n)$ in terms of $p(n-1)$ and $p(n-2)$.
