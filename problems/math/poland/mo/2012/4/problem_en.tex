$n$ players ($n \ge 4$) took part in the tournament. Each player played exactly one match with every other player, there were no draws. There was no four players $(A, B, C, D)$, such that $A$ won with $B$, $B$ won with $C$, $C$ won with $D$ and $D$ won with $A$. Determine, depending on $n$, maximum number of trios of players $(A, B, C)$, such that  $A$ won with $B$, $B$ won with $C$ and $C$ won with $A$.
(Attention: Trios $(A, B, C)$, $(B, C, A)$ and $(C, A, B)$ are the same trio.)
