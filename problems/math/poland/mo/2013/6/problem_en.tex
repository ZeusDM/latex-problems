For each positive integer $n$ determine the maximum number of points in space creating the set $A$ which has the following properties:
$1)$ the coordinates of every point from the set $A$ are integers from the range $[0, n]$
$2)$ for each pair of different points $(x_1,x_2,x_3), (y_1,y_2,y_3)$ belonging to the set $A$ it is satisfied at least one of the following inequalities $x_1< y_1, x_2<y_2, x_3<y_3$ and at least one of the following inequalities $x_1>y_1, x_2>y_2,x_3>y_3$.
