A function $h : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is differentiable and satisfies $h(ax) = bh(x)$ for all $x$, where $a$ and $b$ are given positive numbers and $0 \not = |a| \not = 1$. Suppose that $h'(0) \not = 0$ and the function $h'$ is continuous at $x = 0$. Prove that $a = b$ and that there is a real number $c$ such that $h(x) = cx$ for all $x$.
