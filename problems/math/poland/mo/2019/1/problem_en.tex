Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle. Points $X$ and $Y$ lie on the segments $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, such that $AX=AY$ and the segment $XY$ passes through the orthocenter of the triangle $ABC$. Lines tangent to the circumcircle of the triangle $AXY$ at points $X$ and $Y$ intersect at point $P$. Prove that points $A, B, C, P$ are concyclic.
