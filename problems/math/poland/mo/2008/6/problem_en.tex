Let $ S$ be a set of all positive integers which can be represented as $ a^2 + 5b^2$ for some integers $ a,b$ such that $ a\bot b$. Let $ p$ be a prime number such that $ p = 4n + 3$ for some integer $ n$. Show that if for some positive integer $ k$ the number $ kp$ is in $ S$, then $ 2p$ is in $ S$ as well.

Here, the notation $ a\bot b$ means that the integers $ a$ and $ b$ are coprime.
