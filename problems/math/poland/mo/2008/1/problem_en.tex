In each cell of a matrix $ n\times n$ a number from a set $ \{1,2,\ldots,n^2\}$ is written --- in the first row numbers $ 1,2,\ldots,n$, in the second $ n+1,n+2,\ldots,2n$ and so on. Exactly $ n$ of them have been chosen, no two from the same row or the same column. Let us denote by $ a_i$ a number chosen from row number $ i$. Show that:

\[ \frac{1^2}{a_1}+\frac{2^2}{a_2}+\ldots +\frac{n^2}{a_n}\geq \frac{n+2}{2}-\frac{1}{n^2+1}\]
