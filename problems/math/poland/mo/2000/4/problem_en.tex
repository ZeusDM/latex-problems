$PA_1A_2...A_n$ is a pyramid. The base $A_1A_2...A_n$ is a regular n-gon. The apex $P$ is placed so that the lines $PA_i$ all make an angle $60^{\cdot}$ with the plane of the base. For which $n$ is it possible to find $B_i$ on $PA_i$ for $i = 2, 3, ... , n$ such that $A_1B_2 + B_2B_3 + B_3B_4 + ... + B_{n-1}B_n + B_nA_1 < 2A_1P$?
