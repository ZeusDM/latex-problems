$S$ is a board containing all unit squares in the $xy$ plane whose vertices have integer coordinates and which lie entirely inside the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1998^2$. In each square of $S$ is written $+1$. An allowed move is to change the sign of every square in $S$ in a given row, column or diagonal. Can we end up with exactly one $-1$ and $+1$ on the rest squares by a sequence of allowed moves?
