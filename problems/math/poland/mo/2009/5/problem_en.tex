A sphere is inscribed in tetrahedron $ ABCD$ and is tangent to faces  $ BCD,CAD,ABD,ABC$ at points $ P,Q,R,S$ respectively. Segment $ PT$  is the sphere's diameter, and lines $ TA,TQ,TR,TS$ meet the plane $ BCD$ at points $ A',Q',R',S'$. respectively. Show that $ A$  is the center of a circumcircle on the triangle $ S'Q'R'$.
