Let $ S$ be a set of all points of a plane whose coordinates are integers. Find the smallest positive integer $ k$ for which there exists a 60-element subset of set $ S$ with the following condition satisfied for any two elements  $ A,B$ of the subset there exists a point $ C$ contained in  $ S$ such that the area of triangle $ ABC$ is equal to k .
