A regular $n$-gon is inscribed in a circle radius $1$. Let $X$ be the set of all arcs $PQ$, where $P, Q$ are distinct vertices of the $n$-gon. $5$ elements $L_1, L_2, ... , L_5$ of $X$ are chosen at random (so two or more of the $L_i$ can be the same). Show that the expected length of $L_1 \cap L_2 \cap L_3 \cap L_4 \cap L_5$ is independent of $n$.
