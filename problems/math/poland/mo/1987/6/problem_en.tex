A plane is tiled with regular hexagons of side $1$. $A$ is a fixed hexagon vertex.
Find the number of paths $P$ such that:
(1) one endpoint of $P$ is $A$,
(2) the other endpoint of $P$ is a hexagon vertex,
(3) $P$ lies along hexagon edges,
(4) $P$ has length $60$, and
(5) there is no shorter path along hexagon edges from $A$ to the other endpoint of $P$.
