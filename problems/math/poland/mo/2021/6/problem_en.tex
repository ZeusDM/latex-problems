Given an integer $d \ge 2$ and a circle $\omega$.
Hansel drew a finite number of chords of circle $\omega$.
The following condition is fulfilled: each end of each chord drawn is at least an end of $d$ different drawn chords.
We assume that the chords with a common end intersect.
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
  \item Prove that there is a drawn chord which intersects at least $\tfrac{d^2}{8}$ other drawn chords.
  \item Prove that there is a drawn chord which intersects at least $\tfrac{d^2}{4}$ other drawn chords.
\end{enumerate}
