The sphere inscribed in a tetrahedron $ABCD$ touches face $ABC$ at point $H$. Another sphere touches face $ABC$ at $O$ and the planes containing the other three faces at points exterior to the faces. Prove that if $O$ is the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$, then $H$ is the orthocenter of that triangle.
