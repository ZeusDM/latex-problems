In a tournament, every two of the $n$ players played exactly one match with each other (no
draws). Prove that it is possible either
(i) to partition the league in two groups $A$ and $B$ such that everybody in $A$ defeated everybody in $B$; or
(ii) to arrange all the players in a chain $x_1, x_2, . . . , x_n, x_1$ in such a way that each player defeated his successor.
