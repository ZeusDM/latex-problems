Let be given two parallel lines $k$ and $l$, and a circle not intersecting $k$. Consider a variable point $A$ on the line $k$. The two tangents from this point $A$ to the circle intersect the line $l$ at $B$ and $C$. Let $m$ be the line through the point $A$ and the midpoint of the segment $BC$. Prove that all the lines $m$ (as $A$ varies) have a common point.
