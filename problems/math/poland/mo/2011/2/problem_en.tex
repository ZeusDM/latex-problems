The incircle of triangle $ABC$ is tangent to $BC,CA,AB$ at $D,E,F$ respectively. Consider the triangle formed by the line joining the midpoints of $AE,AF$, the line joining the midpoints of $BF,BD$, and the line joining the midpoints of $CD,CE$. Prove that the circumcenter of this triangle coincides with the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$.
