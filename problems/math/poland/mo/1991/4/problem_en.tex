On the Cartesian plane consider the set $V$ of all vectors with integer coordinates. Determine all functions $f : V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ satisfying the conditions:
(i) $f(v) = 1$ for each of the four vectors $v \in V$ of unit length.
(ii) $f(v+w) = f(v)+f(w)$ for every two perpendicular vectors $v, w \in V$
(Zero vector is considered to be perpendicular to every vector).
