A subset $S$ of size $n$ of a plane consisting of points with both coordinates integer is given, where $n$ is an odd number. The injective function $f\colon S\rightarrow S$ satisfies the following: for each pair of points $A, B\in S$, the distance between points $f(A)$ and $f(B)$ is not smaller than the distance between points $A$ and $B$. Prove there exists a point $X$ such that $f(X)=X$.
