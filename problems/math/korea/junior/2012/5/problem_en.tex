Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral inscirbed in a circle $O$ ($AB> AD$), and let $E$ be a point on segment $AB$ such that $AE = AD$. Let $AC \cap DE = F$, and $DE \cap  O = K(\ne D)$. The tangent to the circle passing through $C,F,E$ at $E$ hits $AK$ at $L$. Prove that $AL = AD$ if and only if $\angle KCE = \angle ALE$.
