There are $n$ students $A_1,A_2,...,A_n$ and some of them shaked hands with each other. ($A_i$ and $A-j$ can shake hands more than one time.) Let the student $A_i$ shaked hands $d_i$ times. Suppose $d_1 + d_2 +... + d_n > 0$. Prove that there exist $1 \le i < j \le n$ satisfying the following conditions:
(a) Two students $A_i$ and $A_j$ shaked hands each other.
(b) $\frac{(d_1 + d_2 +... + d_n)^2}{n^2}\le  d_id_j$
