Let there be $n$ students, numbered $1$ through $n$. Let there be $n$ cards with numbers $1$ through $n$ written on them. Each student picks a card from the stack, and two students are called a pair if they pick each other's number. Let the probability that there are no pairs be $p_n$.
Prove that $p_n - p_{n-1}$ is $0$ is $n$ is odd, and
prove that  $p_n - p_{n-1}= \frac{1}{(-2)^kk^{1-k}}$ if $n = 2k$.
