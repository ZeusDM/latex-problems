A non-isosceles triangle $\triangle ABC$ has its incircle tangent to $BC, CA, AB$ at points $D, E, F$.
Let the incenter be $I$. Say $AD$ hits the incircle again at $G$, at let the tangent to the incircle at $G$ hit $AC$ at $H$. Let $IH \cap AD = K$, and let the foot of the perpendicular from $I$ to $AD$ be $L$.

Prove that $IE \cdot IK= IC \cdot IL$.
