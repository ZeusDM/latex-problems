circle $O_1$ is tangent to $AC$, $BC$(side of triangle $ABC$) at point $D, E$.
circle $O_2$ include $O_1$, is tangent to $BC$, $AB$(side of triangle $ABC$) at point $E, F$
The tangent of $O_2$ at $P(DE \cap O_2, P \neq E)$ meets $AB$ at $Q$.
A line passing through $O_1$(center of $O_1$) and parallel to $BO_2$($O_2$ is also center of $O_2$) meets $BC$ at $G$, $EQ \cap AC=K, KG \cap EF=L$, $EO_2$ meets circle $O_2$ at $N(\neq E)$, $LO_2 \cap FN=M$.
IF $N$ is a middle point of $FM$, prove that $BG=2EG$
