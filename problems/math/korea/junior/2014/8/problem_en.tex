Let there be $n$ students and $m$ clubs. The students joined the clubs so that the following is true:
- For all students $x$, you can choose some clubs such that $x$ is the only student who joined all of the chosen clubs.
Let the number of clubs each student joined be $a_1,a_2,...,a_m$. Prove that
$$a_1!(m - a_1)! + a_2!(m - a_2)! + ... + a_n!(m -a_n)! \le  m!$$
