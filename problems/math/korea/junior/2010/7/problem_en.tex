Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic convex quadrilateral. Let $E$ be the intersection of lines $AB,CD$. $P$ is the intersection
of line passing $B$ and perpendicular to $AC$, and line passing $C$ and perpendicular to $BD$. $Q$ is the intersection
of line passing $D$ and perpendicular to $AC$, and line passing $A$ and perpendicular to $BD$. Prove that three
points $E, P,Q$ are collinear.
