In a rectangle with vertices $(0, 0), (0, 2), (n,0),(n, 2)$, ($n$ is a positive integer) find the number of longest paths
starting from $(0, 0)$ and arriving at $(n, 2)$ which satisfies the following:
At each movement, you can move right, up, left, down by $1$.  You cannot visit a point you visited before. You cannot move outside the rectangle.
