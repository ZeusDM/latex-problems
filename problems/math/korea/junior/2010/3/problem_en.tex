In an acute triangle $\triangle ABC$, let there be point $D$ on segment $AC, E$ on segment $AB$ such that $\angle ADE = \angle ABC$. Let the bisector of $\angle A$ hit $BC$ at $K$. Let the foot of the perpendicular from $K$ to $DE$ be $P$, and the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $DE$ be $L$. Let $Q$ be the midpoint of $AL$. If the incenter of $\triangle ABC$ lies on the circumcircle of $\triangle ADE$, prove that $P,Q$ and the incenter of  $\triangle ADE$ are collinear.
