Let there be a pentagon $ABCDE$ inscribed in a circle $O$. The tangent to $O$ at $E$ is parallel to $AD$. A point $F$ lies on $O$ and it is in the opposite side of $A$ with respect to $CD$, and satisfies $AB \cdot BC \cdot  DF = AE \cdot  ED \cdot  CF$ and $\angle CFD = 2\angle BFE$. Prove that the tangent to $O$ at $B,E$ and line $AF$ concur at one point.
