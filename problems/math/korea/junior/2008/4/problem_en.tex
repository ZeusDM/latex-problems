Let $N$ be the set of positive integers.
If $A,B,C \ne \emptyset, A \cap B = B \cap C = C \cap A = \emptyset$ and $A \cup B \cup C = N$, we say that $A,B,C$ are partitions of $N$. Prove that there are no partitions of $N, A,B,C$, that satisfies the following.
(i) $\forall a \in A, b \in B$, we have $a + b + 1 \in C$
(ii) $\forall  b \in B, c \in C$, we have $b + c + 1 \in A$
(iii) $\forall  c \in C, a \in A$, we have $c + a + 1 \in B$
