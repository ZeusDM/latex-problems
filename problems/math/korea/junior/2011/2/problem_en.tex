Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral inscirbed in circle $O$. Let the tangent to $O$ at $A$ meet $BC$ at $S$, and the tangent to $O$ at $B$ meet $CD$ at $T$. Circle with $S$ as its center and passing $A$ meets $BC$ at $E$, and $AE$ meets $O$ again at $F(\ne A)$. The circle with $T$ as its center and passing $B$ meets $CD$ at $K$. Let $P = BK \cap AC$. Prove that $P,F,D$ are collinear if and only if $AB = AP$.
