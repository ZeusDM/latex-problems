There are $n$ students each having $r$ positive integers. Their $nr$ positive integers are all different. Prove that we can divide the students into $k$ classes satisfying the following conditions:
(a) $k \le 4r$
(b) If a student $A$ has the number $m$, then the student $B$ in the same class can't have a number $\ell$ such that $(m - 1)! < \ell < (m + 1)! + 1$
