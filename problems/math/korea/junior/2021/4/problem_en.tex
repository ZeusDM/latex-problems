In an acute triangle $ABC$ with $\overline{AB} < \overline{AC}$, angle bisector of $A$ and perpendicular bisector of $\overline{BC}$ intersect at $D$. Let $P$ be an interior point of triangle $ABC$. Line $CP$ meets the circumcircle of triangle $ABP$ again at $K$. Prove that $B, D, K$ are collinear if and only if $AD$ and $BC$ meet on the circumcircle of triangle $APC$.
