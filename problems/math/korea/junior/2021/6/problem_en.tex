In a meeting of $4042$ people, there are $2021$ couples, each consisting of two people. Suppose that $A$ and $B$, in the meeting, are friends when they know each other. For a positive integer $n$, each people chooses an integer from $-n$ to $n$ so that the following conditions hold. (Two or more people may choose the same number).
\begin{itemize}
	\item Two or less people chose $0$, and if exactly two people chose $0$, they are coupled.
	\item Two people are either coupled or don't know each other if they chose the same number.
	\item Two people are either coupled or know each other if they chose two numbers that sum to $0$.
\end{itemize}
Determine the least possible value of $n$.
