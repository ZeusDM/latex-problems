In $\triangle ABC$, let the bisector of $\angle BAC$ hit the circumcircle at $M$. Let $P$ be the intersection of $CM$ and $AB$. Denote by $(V,WX,YZ)$ the intersection of the line passing $V$ perpendicular to $WX$ with the line $YZ$. Prove that the points $(P,AM,AC), (P,AC,AM), (P,BC,MB)$ are collinear.
