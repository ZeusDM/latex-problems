For triangle $ABC, P$ and $Q$ satisfy $\angle BPA + \angle AQC = 90^o$. It is provided that the vertices of the triangle $BAP$  and $ACQ$ are ordered counterclockwise (or clockwise). Let the intersection of the circumcircles of the two triangles be $N$ ($A \ne N$, however if $A$ is the only intersection $A = N$), and the midpoint of segment $BC$ be $M$. Show that the length of $MN$ does not depend on $P$ and $Q$.
