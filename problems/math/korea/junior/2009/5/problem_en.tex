Acute triangle $\triangle ABC$ satises $AB < AC$. Let the circumcircle of this triangle be $O$, and the midpoint of $BC,CA,AB$ be $D,E,F$. Let $P$ be the intersection of the circle with $AB$ as its diameter and line $DF$, which is in the same side of $C$ with respect to $AB$. Let $Q$ be the intersection of the circle with $AC$ as its diameter and the line $DE$, which is in the same side of $B$ with respect to $AC$. Let $PQ \cap BC = R$, and let the line passing through $R$ and perpendicular to $BC$ meet $AO$ at $X$. Prove that $AX = XR$.
