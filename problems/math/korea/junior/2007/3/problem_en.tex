Consider the string of length $6$ composed of three characters $a, b, c$. For each string, if two $a$s are next to each other, or two $b$s are next to each other, then replace $aa$ by $b$, and replace $bb$ by $a$. Also, if $a$ and $b$ are next to each other, or two $c$s are next to each other, remove all two of them (i.e. delete $ab, ba, cc$). Determine the number of strings that can be reduced to $c$, the string of length $1$, by the reducing processes mentioned above.
