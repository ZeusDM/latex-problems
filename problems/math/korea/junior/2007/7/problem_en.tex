Let the incircle of $\triangle ABC$ meet $BC,CA,AB$ at $J,K,L$. Let $D(\ne B, J),E(\ne C,K), F(\ne A,L)$ be points on
$BJ,CK,AL$. If the incenter of $\triangle ABC$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle DEF$ and $\angle BAC = \angle DEF$, prove that $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ are isosceles triangles.
