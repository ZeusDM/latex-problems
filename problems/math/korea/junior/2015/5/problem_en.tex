Let $I$ be the incenter of an acute triangle $\triangle ABC$, and let the incircle be $\Gamma$.
Let the circumcircle of $\triangle IBC$ hit $\Gamma$ at $D, E$, where $D$ is closer to $B$ and $E$ is closer to $C$.
Let $\Gamma \cap BE = K (\not= E)$, $CD \cap BI = T$, and $CD \cap \Gamma = L (\not= D)$.
Let the line passing $T$ and perpendicular to $BI$ meet $\Gamma$ at $P$, where $P$ is inside $\triangle IBC$.
Prove that the tangent to $\Gamma$ at $P$, $KL$, $BI$ are concurrent.
