Let there be an acute scalene triangle $ABC$ with circumcenter $O$. Denote $D,E$ be the reflection of $O$ with respect to $AB,AC$, respectively. The circumcircle of $ADE$ meets $AB$, $AC$, the circumcircle of $ABC$ at points $K,L,M$, respectively, and they are all distinct from $A$. Prove that the lines $BC,KL,AM$ are concurrent.
