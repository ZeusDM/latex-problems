Let there be a scalene triangle $ABC$, and denote $M$ by the midpoint of $BC$. The perpendicular bisector of $BC$ meets the circumcircle of $ABC$ at point $P$, on the same side with $A$ with respect to $BC$. Let the incenters of $ABM$ and $AMC$ be $I,J$, respectively. Let $\angle BAC=\alpha$, $\angle ABC=\beta$, $\angle BCA=\gamma$. Find $\angle IPJ$.
