Let there be a scalene triangle $ABC$, and its incircle hits $BC, CA, AB$ at $D, E, F$. The perpendicular bisector of $BC$ meets the circumcircle of $ABC$ at $P, Q$, where $P$ is on the same side with $A$ with respect to $BC$. Let the line parallel to $AQ$ and passing through $D$ meet $EF$ at $R$. Prove that the intersection between $EF$ and $PQ$ lies on the circumcircle of $BCR$.
