$25$ little donkeys stand in a row; the rightmost of them is Eeyore. Winnie-the-Pooh wants to give a balloon of one of the seven colours of the rainbow to each donkey, so that successive donkeys receive balloons of different colours, and so that at least one balloon of each colour is given to some donkey. Eeyore wants to give to each of the $24$ remaining donkeys a pot of one of six colours of the rainbow (except red), so that at least one pot of each colour is given to some donkey (but successive donkeys can receive pots of the same colour). Which of the two friends has more ways to get his plan implemented, and how many times more?Eeyore is a character in the Winnie-the-Pooh books by A. A. Milne. He is generally depicted as a pessimistic, gloomy, depressed, old grey stuffed donkey, who is a friend of the title character, Winnie-the-Pooh. His name is an onomatopoeic representation of the braying sound made by a normal donkey. Of course, Winnie-the-Pooh is a fictional anthropomorphic bear.
