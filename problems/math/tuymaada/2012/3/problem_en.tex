Point $P$ is taken in the interior of the triangle $ABC$, so that $\angle PAB = \angle PCB = \dfrac {1} {4} (\angle A + \angle C).$

Let $L$ be the foot of the angle bisector of $\angle B$. The line $PL$ meets the circumcircle of $\triangle APC$ at point $Q$. Prove that $QB$ is the angle bisector of $\angle AQC$.
