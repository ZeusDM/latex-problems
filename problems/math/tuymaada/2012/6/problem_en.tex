Quadrilateral $ABCD$ is both cyclic and circumscribed. Its incircle touches its sides $AB$ and $CD$ at points $X$ and $Y$,  respectively. The perpendiculars to $AB$ and $CD$ drawn at $A$ and $D$,  respectively, meet at point $U$; those drawn at $X$ and $Y$ meet at point $V$,  and finally, those drawn at $B$ and $C$ meet at point $W$. Prove that points $U$,  $V$ and $W$ are collinear.
