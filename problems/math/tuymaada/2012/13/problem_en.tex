The vertices of a regular $2012$-gon are labeled $A_1,A_2,\ldots, A_{2012}$ in some order. It is known that if $k+\ell$ and $m+n$ leave the same remainder when divided by $2012$,  then the chords $A_kA_{\ell}$ and $A_mA_n$ have no common points. Vasya walks around the polygon and sees that the first two vertices are labeled $A_1$ and $A_4$. How is the tenth vertex labeled?
