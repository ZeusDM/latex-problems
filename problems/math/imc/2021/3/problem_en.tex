We say that a positive real number $d$ is \emph{good} if there exists an infinite squence $a_1,a_2,a_3,...\in (0,d)$ such that for each positive integer $n$, the points $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ partition the interval $[0,d]$ into segments of length at most $\frac{1}{n}$ each. Find $\text{sup}\{d : d  \text{ is  good}\}$.
