Find all sequences $a_{0}, a_{1},\ldots, a_{n}$ of real numbers such that $a_{n}\neq 0$, for which the following statement is true:

If $f: \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ is an $n$ times differentiable function
and $x_{0}<x_{1}<\ldots <x_{n}$ are real numbers such that
$f(x_{0})=f(x_{1})=\ldots =f(x_{n})=0$ then there is $h\in (x_{0}, x_{n})$ for which \[a_{0}f(h)+a_{1}f'(h)+\ldots+a_{n}f^{(n)}(h)=0.\]
