Let $V$ be a convex polygon.
(a) Show that if $V$ has $3k$ vertices, then $V$ can be triangulated such that each vertex is in an odd number of triangles.
(b) Show that if the number of vertices is not divisible with 3, then $V$ can be triangulated such that exactly 2 vertices have an even number of triangles.
