one time 17/20 (by the runner-up)
one time 4/20 (by Andrei Negut)
one time 1/20 (by the winner)
the rest had zero... just to give an idea of the difficulty.


Let $A_{i},B_{i},S_{i}$ ($i=1,2,3$) be invertible real $2\times 2$ matrices such that
\begin{itemize}
	\item not all $A_{i}$ have a common real eigenvector,
	\item $A_{i}=S_{i}^{-1}B_{i}S_{i}$ for $i=1,2,3$,
	\item $A_{1}A_{2}A_{3}=B_{1}B_{2}B_{3}=I$.
\end{itemize}
Prove that there is an invertible $2\times 2$ matrix $S$ such that $A_{i}=S^{-1}B_{i}S$ for all $i=1,2,3$.
