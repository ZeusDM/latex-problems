For every positive integer $n$, let $p(n)$ denote the number of ways to express $n$ as a sum of positive integers. For instance, $p(4)=5$ because

\[4=3+1=2+2=2+1+1=1+1+1.\]

Also define $p(0)=1$.

Prove that $p(n)-p(n-1)$ is the number of ways to express $n$ as a sum of integers each of which is strictly greater than 1.
