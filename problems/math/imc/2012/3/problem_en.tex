Given an integer $n>1$, let $S_n$ be the group of permutations of the numbers $1,\;2,\;3,\;\ldots,\;n$. Two players, A and B, play the following game. Taking turns, they select elements (one element at a time) from the group $S_n$. It is forbidden to select an element that has already been selected. The game ends when the selected elements generate the whole group $S_n$. The player who made the last move loses the game. The first move is made by A. Which player has a winning strategy?
