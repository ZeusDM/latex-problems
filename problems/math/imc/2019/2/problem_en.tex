A four-digit number $YEAR$ is called \textit{very good} if the system
\begin{align*}
Yx+Ey+Az+Rw& =Y\\
Rx+Yy+Ez+Aw & = E\\\
Ax+Ry+Yz+Ew & = A\\
Ex+Ay+Rz+Yw &= R
\end{align*}of linear equations in the variables $x,y,z$ and $w$ has at least two solutions. Find all very good $YEAR$s in the 21st century.

(The $21$st century starts in $2001$ and ends in $2100$.)
