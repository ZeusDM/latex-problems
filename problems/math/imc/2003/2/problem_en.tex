Let $a_1, a_2,...,a_{51}$ be non-zero elements of a field of characteristic $p$. We simultaneously replace each element with the sum of the 50 remaining ones. In this way we get a sequence $b_1, ... , b_{51}$. If this new sequence is a permutation of the original one, find all possible values of $p$.
