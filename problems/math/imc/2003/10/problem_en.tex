Find all the positive integers $n$ for  which there exists a Family $\mathcal{F}$ of three-element subsets of $S=\{1,2,...,n\}$ satisfying
\[\text{(i) for any two different  elements $a,b \in S$ there exists exactly one $A \in \mathcal{F}$ containing both $a$ and $b$;}\]\[\text{(ii) if $a,b,c,x,y,z$ are elements of $S$ such that $\{a,b,x\},\{a,c,y\},\{b,c,z\} \in \mathcal{F}$, then $\{x,y,z\} \in \mathcal{F} $  }.\]
