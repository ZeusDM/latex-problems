Prove or disprove the following statements:
(a) There exists a monotone function $f : [0, 1] \rightarrow [0, 1]$ such that for each $y \in [0, 1]$ the equation $f(x) = y$ has uncountably many solutions $x$.
(b) There exists a continuously differentiable function $f : [0, 1] \rightarrow [0, 1]$ such that for each $y \in [0, 1]$ the equation $f(x) = y$ has uncountably many solutions $x$.
