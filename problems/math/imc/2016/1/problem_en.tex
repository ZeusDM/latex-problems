Let $f : \left[ a, b\right]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be continuous on $\left[ a, b\right]$ and differentiable on $\left( a, b\right)$. Suppose that $f$ has infinitely many zeros, but there is no $x\in \left( a, b\right)$ with $f(x)=f'(x)=0$.
(a) Prove that $f(a)f(b)=0$.
(b) Give an example of such a function on $\left[ 0, 1\right]$.
