Let $k$ and $n$ be positive integers. A sequence $\left( A_1, \dots , A_k \right)$ of $n\times n$ real matrices is \textit{preferred} by Ivan the Confessor if $A_i^2\neq 0$ for $1\le i\le k$, but $A_iA_j=0$ for $1\le i$, $j\le k$ with $i\neq j$. Show that $k\le n$ in all preferred sequences, and give an example of a preferred sequence with $k=n$ for each $n$.
