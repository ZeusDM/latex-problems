Let $n\ge k$ be positive integers, and let $\mathcal{F}$ be a family of finite sets with the following properties:
(i) $\mathcal{F}$ contains at least $\binom{n}{k}+1$ distinct sets containing exactly $k$ elements;
(ii) for any two sets $A, B\in \mathcal{F}$, their union $A\cup B$ also belongs to $\mathcal{F}$.
Prove that $\mathcal{F}$ contains at least three sets with at least $n$ elements.
