Let $ n$ be a positive integer. Consider an $ n\times n$ matrix with entries $ 1,2,...,n^2$ written in order, starting at the top left and moving along each row in turn left-to-right. (e.g. for $ n = 3$ we get $ \left[\begin{array}{ccc}1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9\end{array}\right]$)
We choose $ n$ entries of the matrix such that exactly one entry is chosen in each row and each column. What are the possible values of the sum of the selected entries?
