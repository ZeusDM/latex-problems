Let $a_{0}=\sqrt{2}, b_{0}=2,a_{n+1}=\sqrt{2-\sqrt{4-a_{n}^{2}}},b_{n+1}=\frac{2b_{n}}{2+\sqrt{4+b_{n}^{2}}}$.
a) Prove that the sequences $(a_{n})$ and $(b_{n})$ are decreasing and converge to $0$.
b) Prove that the sequence $(2^{n}a_{n})$ is increasing,  the sequence $(2^{n}b_{n})$ is decreasing and
both converge to the same limit.
c) Prove that there exists a positive constant $C$ such that for all $n$  the following inequality holds: $0 <b_{n}-a_{n} <\frac{C}{8^{n}}$.
