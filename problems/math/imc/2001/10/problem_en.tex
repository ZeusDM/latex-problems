Let $A=(a_{k,l})_{k,l=1,...,n}$ be a complex $n \times n$ matrix such that for each $m \in \{1,2,...,n\}$ and $1 \leq  j_{1} <...<j_{m}$ the determinant of the matrix $(a_{j_{k},j_{l}})_{k,l=1,...,n}$ is zero. Prove that $A^{n}=0$ and that there exists a permutation $\sigma \in S_{n}$ such that the matrix $(a_{\sigma(k),\sigma(l)})_{k,l=1,...,n}$ has all of its nonzero elements above the diagonal.
