Let $\alpha$ be a real number, $1<\alpha<2$.

(a) Show that $\alpha$ can uniquely be represented as the infinte product \[ \alpha = \left(1+\dfrac1{n_1}\right)\left(1+\dfrac1{n_2}\right)\cdots \] with $n_i$ positive integers satisfying $n_i^2\le n_{i+1}$.

(b) Show that $\alpha\in\mathbb{Q}$ iff from some $k$ onwards we have $n_{k+1}=n_k^2$.
