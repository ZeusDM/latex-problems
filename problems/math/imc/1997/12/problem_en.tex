Let $f: [0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ continuous. We say that $f$ crosses the axis at $x$ if $f(x)=0$ but $\exists y,z \in [x-\epsilon,x+\epsilon]: f(y)<0<f(z)$ for any $\epsilon$.

(a) Give an example of a function that crosses the axis infinitely often.

(b) Can a continuous function cross the axis uncountably often?
