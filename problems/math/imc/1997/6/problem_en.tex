Suppose $F$ is a family of finite subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ and for any 2 sets $A,B \in F$ we have $A \cap B \not= \O$.

(a) Is it true that there is a finite subset $Y$ of $\mathbb{N}$ such that for any $A,B \in F$ we have $A\cap B\cap Y \not= \O$?
(b) Is the above true if we assume that all members of $F$ have the same size?
