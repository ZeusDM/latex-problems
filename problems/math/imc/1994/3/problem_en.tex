Given a set $S$ of $2n-1$, $n\in \mathbb N$, different irrational numbers. Prove that there are $n$ different elements $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\in S$ such that for all non-negative rational numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ with $a_1+a_2+\ldots + a_n>0$ we have that $a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots +a_nx_n$ is an irrational number.
