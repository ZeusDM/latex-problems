Let $f$ be a real-valued function with $n+1$ derivatives at each point of $\mathbb R$. Show that for each pair of real numbers $a$, $b$, $a<b$, such that
$$\ln\left( \frac{f(b)+f'(b)+\cdots + f^{(n)} (b)}{f(a)+f'(a)+\cdots + f^{(n)}(a)}\right)=b-a$$there is a number $c$ in the open interval $(a,b)$ for which
$$f^{(n+1)}(c)=f(c)$$
