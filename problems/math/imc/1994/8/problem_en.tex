Let $f\colon \mathbb R ^2 \rightarrow \mathbb R$ be given by $f(x,y)=(x^2-y^2)e^{-x^2-y^2}$.

a) Prove that $f$ attains its minimum and its maximum.

b) Determine all points $(x,y)$ such that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x,y)=0$ and determine for which of them $f$ has global or local minimum or maximum.
