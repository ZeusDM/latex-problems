Let $n\ge2$, let $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_{n+1}$ be $n+1$ points in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space, not lying on the same hyperplane, and let $B$ be a point strictly inside the convex hull of $A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_{n+1}$. Prove that $\angle A_iBA_j > 90^\circ$ holds for at least $n$ pairs $(i,j)$ with $\displaystyle{1\le i < j\le n+1}$.
