Consider the following statement: for any permutation $\pi_1\not=\mathbb{I}$ of $\{1,2,...,n\}$ there is a permutation $\pi_2$ such that any permutation on these numbers can be obtained by a finite compostion of $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$.

(a) Prove the statement for $n=3$ and $n=5$.
(b) Disprove the statement for $n=4$.
