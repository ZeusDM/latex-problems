$f: (0,1) \rightarrow [0, \infty)$ is zero except at a countable set of points $a_{1}, a_2, a_3, ... $ . Let $b_n = f(a_n)$. Show that if $\sum b_{n}$ converges, then $f$ is differentiable at at least one point. Show that for any sequence $b_{n}$ of non-negative reals with  $\sum b_{n} =\infty$ , we can find a sequence $a_{n}$ such that the function $f$ defined as above is nowhere differentiable.
