Let $V$ be a 10-dimensional real vector space and $U_1,U_2$ two linear subspaces such that $U_1 \subseteq U_2, \dim U_1 =3, \dim U_2=6$. Let $\varepsilon$ be the set of all linear maps $T: V\rightarrow V$ which have $T(U_1)\subseteq U_1, T(U_2)\subseteq U_2$. Calculate the dimension of $\varepsilon$. (again, all as real vector spaces)
