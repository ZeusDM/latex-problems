The linear operator $A$ on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ is called an involution if
$A^{2}=I$, where $I$ is the identity operator. Let $\dim V=n$.
i) Prove that for every involution $A$ on $V$, there exists a basis of $V$ consisting of eigenvectors
of $A$.
ii) Find the maximal number of distinct pairwise commuting involutions on $V$.
