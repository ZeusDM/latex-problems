Upper content of a subset $E$ of the plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is defined as
$$\mathcal{C}(E)=\inf\{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{diam}(E_{i})\}$$where $\inf$ is taken over all finite families of sets $E_{1},\dots,E_{n}$ $n\in \mathbb{N}$, in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
such that $E\subset \bigcup_{i=1}^{n}E_{i}$.
Lower content of $E$ is defined as
$$\mathcal{K}(E)=\sup\{\text{length}(L) |\, L \text{ is a closed line segment onto which $E$ can be contracted}\}$$.
Prove that
i) $\mathcal{C}(L)=\text{length}(L)$ if $L$ is a closed line segment;
ii) $\mathcal{C}(E) \geq \mathcal{K}(E)$;
iii) the equality in ii) is not always true even if $E$ is compact.
