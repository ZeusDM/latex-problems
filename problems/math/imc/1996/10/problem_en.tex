Let $B$ be a bounded closed convex symmetric (with respect to the origin) set in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with boundary $\Gamma$. Let $B$ have the property that the ellipse of maximal area contained in $B$ is the disc $D$ of radius $1$ centered at the origin with boundary $C$. Prove that $A \cap \Gamma \ne \emptyset$ for any arc $A$ of $C$ of length $l(A)\geq \frac{\pi}{2}$.
