Does there exist an infinite set $\displaystyle{M}$ consisting of positive integers such that for any  $\displaystyle{a,b \in M}$ with $\displaystyle{a < b}$ the sum $\displaystyle{a + b}$ is square-free?
\textit{Note.} A positive integer is called  square-free if no perfect square greater than  $\displaystyle{1}$ divides it.
