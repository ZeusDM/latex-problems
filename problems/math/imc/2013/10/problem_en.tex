Consider a circular necklace with $\displaystyle{2013}$ beads. Each bead can be paintes either green or white. A painting of the necklace is called  \textit{good} if among any $\displaystyle{21}$ successive beads there is at least one green bead. Prove that the number of good paintings of the necklace is odd.

\textit{Note.} Two paintings that differ on some beads, but can be obtained from each other by rotating or flipping the necklace, are counted as different paintings.
