Suppose that $\displaystyle{{v_1},{v_2},...,{v_d}}$ are unit vectors in $\displaystyle{{{\Bbb R}^d}}$.  Prove that there exists a unitary vector $\displaystyle{u}$ such that $\displaystyle{\left| {u \cdot {v_i}} \right| \leq \frac{1}{{\sqrt d }}}$ for $\displaystyle{i = 1,2,...,d}$.

\textit{Note.} Here $\displaystyle{ \cdot }$ denotes the usual scalar product on $\displaystyle{{{\Bbb R}^d}}$.
