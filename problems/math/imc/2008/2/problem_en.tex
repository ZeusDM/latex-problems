Denote by $\mathbb{V}$ the real vector space of all real polynomials in one variable, and let $\gamma :\mathbb{V}\to \mathbb{R}$ be a linear map. Suppose that for all $f,g\in \mathbb{V}$ with $\gamma(fg)=0$ we have $\gamma(f)=0$ or $\gamma(g)=0$. Prove that there exist $c,x_0\in \mathbb{R}$ such that
\[ \gamma(f)=cf(x_0)\quad \forall f\in \mathbb{V}\]
