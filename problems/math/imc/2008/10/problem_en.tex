Let $ \mathbb{Z}[x]$ be the ring of polynomials with integer coefficients, and let $ f(x), g(x) \in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ be nonconstant polynomials such that $ g(x)$ divides $ f(x)$ in $ \mathbb{Z}[x]$. Prove that if the polynomial $ f(x)-2008$ has at least 81 distinct integer roots, then the degree of $ g(x)$ is greater than 5.
