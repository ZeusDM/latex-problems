Let $ \mathcal{H}$ be an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, let $ d>0$, and suppose that $ S$ is a set of points (not necessarily countable) in $ \mathcal{H}$ such that the distance between any two distinct points in $ S$ is equal to $ d$. Show that there is a point $ y\in\mathcal{H}$ such that
\[ \left\{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{d}(x-y): \ x\in S\right\}\]
is an orthonormal system of vectors in $ \mathcal{H}$.
