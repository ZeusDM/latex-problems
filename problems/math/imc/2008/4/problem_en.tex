We say a triple of real numbers $ (a_1,a_2,a_3)$ is \textit{better} than another triple $ (b_1,b_2,b_3)$ when exactly two out of the three following inequalities hold: $ a_1 > b_1$, $ a_2 > b_2$, $ a_3 > b_3$. We call a triple of real numbers \textit{special} when they are nonnegative and their sum is $ 1$.

For which natural numbers $ n$ does there exist a collection $ S$ of special triples, with $ |S| = n$, such that any special triple is bettered by at least one element of $ S$?
