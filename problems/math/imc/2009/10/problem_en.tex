Let $\mathbb{M}$ be the vector space of $m \times p$ real matrices. For a vector subspace $S\subseteq \mathbb{M}$, denote by $\delta(S)$ the dimension of the vector space generated by all columns of all matrices in $S$.
Say that a vector subspace $T\subseteq \mathbb{M}$ is a $\emph{covering matrix space}$ if
\[ \bigcup_{A\in T, A\ne \mathbf{0}} \ker A =\mathbb{R}^p \]
Such a $T$ is minimal if it doesn't contain a proper vector subspace $S\subset T$ such that $S$ is also a covering matrix space.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Let $T$ be a minimal covering matrix space and let $n=\dim (T)$
Prove that
\[ \delta(T)\le \dbinom{n}{2} \]
  \item Prove that for every integer $n$ we can find $m$ and $p$, and a minimal covering matrix space $T$ as above such that $\dim T=n$ and $\delta(T)=\dbinom{n}{2}$
\end{itemize}
