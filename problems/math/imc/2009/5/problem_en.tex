Let $n$ be a positive integer. An $n-\emph{simplex}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by $n+1$ points $P_0, P_1,\cdots  , P_n$, called its vertices, which do not all belong to the same hyperplane. For every $n$-simplex $\mathcal{S}$ we denote by $v(\mathcal{S})$ the volume of $\mathcal{S}$, and we write $C(\mathcal{S})$ for the center of the unique sphere containing all the vertices of $\mathcal{S}$.
Suppose that $P$ is a point inside an $n$-simplex $\mathcal{S}$. Let $\mathcal{S}_i$ be the $n$-simplex obtained from $\mathcal{S}$ by replacing its $i^{\text{th}}$ vertex by $P$. Prove that :
\[ \sum_{j=0}^{n}v(\mathcal{S}_j)C(\mathcal{S}_j)=v(\mathcal{S})C(\mathcal{S}) \]
