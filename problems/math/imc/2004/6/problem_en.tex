For every complex number $z$ different from 0 and 1 we define the following function
\[  f(z) := \sum \frac 1 {  \log^4 z } \]
where the sum is over all branches of the complex logarithm.

a) Prove that there are two polynomials $P$ and $Q$ such that $f(z) = \displaystyle \frac {P(z)}{Q(z)} $ for all $z\in\mathbb{C}-\{0,1\}$.

b) Prove that for all $z\in \mathbb{C}-\{0,1\}$ we have

\[ f(z) = \frac { z^3+4z^2+z}{6(z-1)^4}. \]
