For $n\geq 1$ let $M$ be an $n\times n$ complex array with distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_k$, with multiplicities $m_1,m_2,\ldots,m_k$ respectively. Consider the linear operator $L_M$ defined by $L_MX=MX+XM^T$, for any complex $n\times n$ array $X$. Find its eigenvalues and their multiplicities. ($M^T$ denotes the transpose matrix of $M$).
