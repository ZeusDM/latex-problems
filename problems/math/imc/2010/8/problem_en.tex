Denote by $S_n$ the group of permutations of the sequence $(1,2,\dots,n).$ Suppose that $G$ is a subgroup of $S_n,$ such that for every $\pi\in G\setminus\{e\}$ there exists a unique $k\in \{1,2,\dots,n\}$ for which $\pi(k)=k.$ (Here $e$ is the unit element of the group $S_n.$) Show that this $k$ is the same for all $\pi \in G\setminus \{e\}.$
