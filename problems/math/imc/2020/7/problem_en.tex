Let $G$ be a group and $n \ge 2$ be an integer. Let $H_1, H_2$ be $2$ subgroups of $G$ that satisfy $$[G: H_1] = [G: H_2] = n \text{ and } [G: (H_1 \cap H_2)] = n(n-1).$$Prove that $H_1, H_2$ are conjugate in $G.$

Official definitions: $[G:H]$ denotes the index of the subgroup of $H,$ i.e. the number of distinct left cosets $xH$ of $H$ in $G.$ The subgroups $H_1, H_2$ are conjugate if there exists $g \in G$ such that $g^{-1} H_1 g = H_2.$
