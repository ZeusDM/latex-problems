Let $n$ be a positive integer. Compute the number of words $w$ that satisfy the following three properties.

1. $w$ consists of $n$ letters from the alphabet $\{a,b,c,d\}.$

2. $w$ contains an even number of $a$'s

3. $w$ contains an even number of $b$'s.

For example, for $n=2$ there are $6$ such words: $aa, bb, cc, dd, cd, dc.$
