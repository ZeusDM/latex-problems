Let $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. A point $x$ is called a \textit{shadow} point if there exists a point $y\in \mathbb{R}$ with $y>x$ such that $f(y)>f(x).$ Let $a<b$ be real numbers and suppose that
$\bullet$ all the points of the open interval $I=(a,b)$ are shadow points;
$\bullet$ $a$ and $b$ are not shadow points.
Prove that
a) $f(x)\leq f(b)$ for all $a<x<b;$
b) $f(a)=f(b).$
