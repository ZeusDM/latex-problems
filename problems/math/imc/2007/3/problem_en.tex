Call a polynomial $ P(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k})$ \textit{good} if there exist $ 2\times 2$ real matrices $ A_{1}, \ldots, A_{k}$ such that
\[P(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{k}) = \det \left(\sum_{i=1}^{k}x_{i}A_{i}\right).\]

Find all values of $ k$ for which all homogeneous polynomials with $ k$ variables of degree 2 are good. (A polynomial is homogeneous if each term has the same total degree.)
