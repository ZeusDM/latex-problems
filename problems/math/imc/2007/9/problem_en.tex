Let $ C$ be a nonempty closed bounded subset of the real line and $ f: C\to C$ be a nondecreasing continuous function. Show that there exists a point $ p\in C$ such that $ f(p) = p$.
(A set is closed if its complement is a union of open intervals. A function $ g$ is nondecreasing if $ g(x)\le g(y)$ for all $ x\le y$.)
