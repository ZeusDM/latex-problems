Let $ G$ be a finite group. For arbitrary sets $ U, V, W \subset G$, denote by $ N_{UVW}$ the number of triples $ (x, y, z) \in U \times V \times W$ for which $ xyz$ is the unity .
Suppose that $ G$ is partitioned into three sets $ A, B$ and $ C$ (i.e. sets $ A, B, C$ are pairwise disjoint and $ G = A \cup B \cup C$). Prove that $ N_{ABC}= N_{CBA}.$
