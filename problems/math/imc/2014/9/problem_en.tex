We say that a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is $k$-\textit{almost contained} by a hyperplane if there are less than $k$ points in that set which do not belong to the hyperplane. We call a finite set of points $k$-\textit{generic} if there is no hyperplane that $k$-almost contains the set. For each pair of positive integers $(k, n)$, find the minimal number of $d(k, n)$ such that every finite $k$-generic set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ contains a $k$-generic subset with at most $d(k, n)$ elements.
