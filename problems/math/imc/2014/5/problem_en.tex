Let $A_{1}A_{2} \dots A_{3n}$ be a closed broken line consisting of $3n$ lines segments in the Euclidean plane. Suppose that no three of its vertices are collinear, and for each index $i=1,2,\dots,3n$, the triangle $A_{i}A_{i+1}A_{i+2}$ has counterclockwise orientation and $\angle A_{i}A_{i+1}A_{i+2} = 60ยบ$, using the notation $A_{3n+1} = A_{1}$ and $A_{3n+2} = A_{2}$. Prove that the number of self-intersections of the broken line is at most $\frac{3}{2}n^{2} - 2n + 1$
