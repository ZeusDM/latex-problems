For a positive integer $x$, denote its $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ decimal digit by $d_n(x)$, i.e. $d_n(x)\in \{ 0,1, \dots, 9\}$ and $x=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} d_n(x)10^{n-1}$. Suppose that for some sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$, there are only finitely many zeros in the sequence $(d_n(a_n))_{n=1}^{\infty}$. Prove that there are infinitely many positive integers that do not occur in the sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$.
