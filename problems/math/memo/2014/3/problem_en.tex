Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB < AC$ and incentre $I$. Let $E$ be the point on the side $AC$ such that $AE = AB$. Let $G$ be the point on the line $EI$ such that $\angle IBG = \angle CBA$ and such that $E$ and $G$ lie on opposite sides of $I$.

Prove that the line $AI$,  the line perpendicular to $AE$ at $E$,  and the bisector of the angle $\angle BGI$ are concurrent.
