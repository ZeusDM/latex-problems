For a positive integer $n$,  the equation $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + n = abc$ is given in the positive integers.

Prove that:

1. There does not exist a solution $(a, b, c)$ for $n = 2017$.

2. For $n = 2016$,  $a$ is divisible by $3$ for all solutions $(a, b, c)$.

3. There are infinitely many solutions $(a, b, c)$ for $n = 2016$.
