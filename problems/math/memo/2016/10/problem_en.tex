Let $ABC$ be a triangle for which $AB \neq AC$. Points $K$,  $L$,  $M$ are the midpoints of the sides $BC$,  $CA$,  $AB$.

The incircle of $ABC$ with center $I$ is tangent to $BC$ in $D$. A line passing through the midpoint of $ID$ perpendicular to $IK$ meets the line $LM$ in $P$.

Prove that $\angle PIA = 90 ^{\circ}$.
