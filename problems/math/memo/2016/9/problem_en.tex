Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle for which $AB \neq AC$,  and let $O$ be its circumcenter. Line $AO$ meets the circumcircle of $ABC$ again in $D$,  and the line $BC$ in $E$. The circumcircle of $CDE$ meets the line $CA$ again in $P$. The lines $PE$ and $AB$ intersect in $Q$. Line passing through $O$ parallel to the line $PE$ intersects the $A$-altitude of $ABC$ in $F$.

Prove that $FP = FQ$.
