All positive divisors of a positive integer $N$ are written on a blackboard. Two players $A$ and $B$ play the following game taking alternate moves. In the firt move, the player $A$ erases $N$. If the last erased number is $d$,  then the next player erases either a divisor of $d$ or a multiple of $d$. The player who cannot make a move loses. Determine all numbers $N$ for which $A$ can win independently of the moves of $B$.(4th Middle European Mathematical Olympiad, Individual Competition, Problem 2)
