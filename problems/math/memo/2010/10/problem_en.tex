Let $A$,  $B$,  $C$,  $D$,  $E$ be points such that $ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral and $ABDE$ is a parallelogram. The diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $S$ and the rays $AB$ and $DC$ intersect at $F$. Prove that $\sphericalangle{AFS}=\sphericalangle{ECD}$.(4th Middle European Mathematical Olympiad, Team Competition, Problem 6)
