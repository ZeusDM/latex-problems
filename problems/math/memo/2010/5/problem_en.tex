Three strictly increasing sequences\[a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots,\qquad b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots,\qquad c_1, c_2, c_3, \ldots\]

of positive integers are given. Every positive integer belongs to exactly one of the three sequences. For every positive integer $n$,  the following conditions hold:

(a) $c_{a_n}=b_n+1$;

(b) $a_{n+1}>b_n$;

(c) the number $c_{n+1}c_{n}-(n+1)c_{n+1}-nc_n$ is even.

Find $a_{2010}$,  $b_{2010}$ and $c_{2010}$.(4th Middle European Mathematical Olympiad, Team Competition, Problem 1)
