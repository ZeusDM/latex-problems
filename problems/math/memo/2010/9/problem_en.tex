The incircle of the triangle $ABC$ touches the sides $BC$,  $CA$,  and $AB$ in the points $D$,  $E$ and $F$,  respectively. Let $K$ be the point symmetric to $D$ with respect to the incenter. The lines $DE$ and $FK$ intersect at $S$. Prove that $AS$ is parallel to $BC$.(4th Middle European Mathematical Olympiad, Team Competition, Problem 5)
