Find all positive integers $n$ which satisfy the following tow conditions:

(a) $n$ has at least four different positive divisors;

(b) for any divisors $a$ and $b$ of $n$ satisfying $1<a<b<n$,  the number $b-a$ divides $n$.(4th Middle European Mathematical Olympiad, Individual Competition, Problem 4)
