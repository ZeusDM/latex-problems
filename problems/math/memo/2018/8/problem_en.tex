Let $n$ be a positive integer and $u_1,u_2,\cdots ,u_n$ be positive integers not larger than $2^k, $ for some  integer  $k\geq 3.$ A representation of  a non-negative  integer $t$ is a sequence of  non-negative  integers $a_1,a_2,\cdots ,a_n$ such that $t=a_1u_1+a_2u_2+\cdots +a_nu_n.$

Prove that if a non-negative  integer $t$  has a representation,then it also has a  representation  where less than $2k$ of numbers $a_1,a_2,\cdots ,a_n$ are non-zero.
