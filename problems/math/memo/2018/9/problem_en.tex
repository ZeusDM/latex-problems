Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled  triangle with $AB<AC,$  and let $D$ be the foot of its altitude from$A,$ points $B'$ and $C'$ lie on the rays $AB$ and $AC,$ respectively , so that points $B',$ $C'$ and $D$ are collinear and points $B,$ $C,$ $B'$ and $C'$ lie on one circle with center $O.$ Prove that if $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$ and $H$ is the orthocenter of  $ABC,$  then $DHMO$ is a parallelogram.
