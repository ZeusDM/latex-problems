The two figures depicted below consisting of $6$ and $10$ unit squares, respectively, are called staircases.

Consider a $2018\times  2018$ board consisting of $2018^2$ cells, each being a unit square. Two arbitrary

cells were removed from the same row of the board. Prove that the rest of the board cannot be cut (along the cell borders) into staircases (possibly rotated).
