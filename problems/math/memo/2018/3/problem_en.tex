Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled  triangle with $AB<AC,$  and let $D$ be the foot of its altitude from$A.$ Let $R$ and $Q$ be the centroids of  triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$,  respectively. Let $P$ be a point on the line segment $BC$ such that $P \neq D$ and points $P$ $Q$ $R$ and $D$ are concyclic .Prove that the lines $AP$ $BQ$ and $CR$  are concurrent.
