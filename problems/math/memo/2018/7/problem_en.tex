A graup of pirates had an argument and not each of them holds some other two at gunpoint.All the pirates are called one by one in some order.If the called pirate is still alive , he shoots both pirates  he is aiming at ( some of whom might already be dead .) All shorts are immediatcly  lethal .  After all the pirates have been called , it turns out the exactly $28$ pirates got killed . Prove that if the pirates  were called in whatever other order , at least $10$ pirates would have been killed anyway.
