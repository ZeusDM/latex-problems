Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial of degree  $n\geq 2$ with rational coefficients such that $P(x) $ has $ n$ pairwise different reel roots forming an arithmetic progression .Prove that among the roots of $P(x) $ there are two that are also the roots of some polynomial of degree $2$ with rational  coefficients .
