(a) Prove that for every positive integer $m$ there exists an integer $n\ge m$ such that$$\left \lfloor \frac{n}{1} \right \rfloor \cdot \left \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right \rfloor \cdots \left \lfloor \frac{n}{m} \right \rfloor =\binom{n}{m} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\        (*)$$(b) Denote by $p(m)$ the smallest integer $n \geq m$ such that the equation  $ (*)$ holds. Prove that$p(2018) = p(2019).$

Remark: For a real number $x,$  we denote by $\left \lfloor x \right \rfloor$  the largest integer not larger than $x.$
