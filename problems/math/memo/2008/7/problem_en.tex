Let $ ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle. Let $ E$ be a point such $ E$ and $ B$ are on distinct sides of the line $ AC,$ and $ D$ is an interior point of segment $ AE.$ We have $ \angle ADB = \angle CDE,$ $ \angle BAD = \angle ECD,$ and $ \angle ACB = \angle EBA.$ Prove that $ B, C$ and $ E$ lie on the same line.
