Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with $AB > AC$ and circumcircle $\Gamma$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of the shorter arc $BC$ of $\Gamma$,  and let $D$ be the intersection of the rays $AC$ and $BM$. Let $E \neq C$ be the intersection of the internal bisector of the angle $ACB$ and the circumcircle of the triangle $BDC$. Let us assume that $E$ is inside the triangle $ABC$ and there is an intersection $N$ of the line $DE$ and the circle $\Gamma$ such that $E$ is the midpoint of the segment $DN$.

Show that $N$ is the midpoint of the segment $I_B I_C$,  where $I_B$ and $I_C$ are the excentres of $ABC$ opposite to $B$ and $C$,  respectively.
