Let $n \geq 3$ be an integer. A sequence $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$ of distinct points in the plane is called good if no three of them are collinear, the polyline $P_1P_2 \ldots P_n$ is non-self-intersecting and the triangle $P_iP_{i + 1}P_{i + 2}$ is oriented counterclockwise for every $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n - 2$.

For every integer $n \geq 3$ determine the greatest possible integer $k$ with the following property: there exist $n$ distinct points $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ in the plane for which there are $k$ distinct permutations $\sigma : \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \to \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ such that $A_{\sigma(1)}, A_{\sigma(2)}, \ldots, A_{\sigma(n)}$ is good.

(A polyline $P_1P_2 \ldots P_n$ consists of the segments $P_1P_2, P_2P_3, \ldots, P_{n - 1}P_n$.)
