Suppose that $ ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral and $ CD=DA$. Points $ E$ and $ F$ belong to the segments $ AB$ and $ BC$ respectively, and $ \angle ADC=2\angle EDF$. Segments $ DK$ and $ DM$ are height and median of triangle $ DEF$,  respectively. $ L$ is the point symmetric to $ K$ with respect to $ M$. Prove that the lines $ DM$ and $ BL$ are parallel.
