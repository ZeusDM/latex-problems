There are $n \ge 2$ houses on the northern side of a street. Going from the west to the east, the houses are numbered from 1 to $n$. The number of each house is shown on a plate. One day the inhabitants of the street make fun of the postman by shuffling their number plates in the following way: for each pair of neighbouring houses, the currnet number plates are swapped exactly once during the day.

How many different sequences of number plates are possible at the end of the day?
