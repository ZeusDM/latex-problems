Let $K$ be a point inside an acute triangle $ ABC $,  such that $ BC $ is a common tangent of the circumcircles of $ AKB $ and $ AKC$. Let $ D $ be the intersection of the lines $ CK $ and $ AB $,  and let $ E $ be the intersection of the lines $ BK $ and $ AC $ . Let $ F $ be the intersection of the line $BC$ and the perpendicular bisector of the segment $DE$. The circumcircle of $ABC$ and the circle $k$ with centre $ F$ and radius $FD$ intersect at points $P$ and $Q$.

Prove that the segment $PQ$ is a diameter of $k$.
