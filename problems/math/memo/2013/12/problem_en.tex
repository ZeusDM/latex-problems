The expression\[ \pm \Box \pm \Box \pm \Box \pm \Box \pm \Box \pm \Box \]

is written on the blackboard. Tow players, $ A $ and $ B $,  play a game, taking turns. Player $ A $ takes the first turn. In each turn, the player on turn replaces a symbol $ \Box $ by a positive integer. After all the symbols $\Box$ are replace, player $A$ replaces each of the signs $\pm$ by either + or -, independently of each other. Player $ A $ wins if the value of the expression on the blackboard is not divisible by any of the numbers $ 11, 12, \cdots, 18 $. Otherwise, player $ B$ wins. Determine which player has a winning strategy.
