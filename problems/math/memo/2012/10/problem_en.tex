Let $ ABCD $ be a convex quadrilateral with no pair of parallel sides, such that $ \angle ABC  = \angle CDA $. Assume that the intersections of the pairs of neighbouring angle bisectors of $ ABCD $ form a convex quadrilateral $ EFGH $. Let $ K $ be the intersection of the diagonals of $ EFGH$. Prove that the lines $ AB $ and $ CD $ intersect on the circumcircle of the triangle $ BKD $.
