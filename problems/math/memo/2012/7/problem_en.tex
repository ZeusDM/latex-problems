Let $ n $ be a positive integer. Consider words of length $n$ composed of letters from the set $ \{ M, E, O \} $. Let $ a $ be the number of such words containing an even number (possibly 0) of blocks $ ME $ and an even number (possibly 0) blocks of $ MO $ . Similarly let $ b $ the number of such words containing an odd number of blocks $ ME $ and an odd number of blocks $ MO $. Prove that $ a>b $.
