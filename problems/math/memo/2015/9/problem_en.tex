Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $AB>AC$. Prove that there exists a point $D$ with the following property: whenever two distinct points $X$ and $Y$ lie in the interior of $ABC$ such that the points $B$,  $C$,  $X$,  and $Y$ lie on a circle and$$\angle AXB-\angle ACB=\angle CYA-\angle CBA$$

holds, the line $XY$ passes through $D$.
