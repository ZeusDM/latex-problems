Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral. Let $E$ be the intersection of lines parallel to $AC$ and $BD$ passing through points $B$ and $A$,  respectively. The lines $EC$ and $ED$ intersect the circumcircle of $AEB$ again at $F$ and $G$,  respectively. Prove that points $C$,  $D$,  $F$,  and $G$ lie on a circle.
