Let $ k$ be a circle and $ k_{1},k_{2},k_{3},k_{4}$ four smaller circles with their centres $ O_{1},O_{2},O_{3},O_{4}$ respectively, on $ k$. For $ i = 1,2,3,4$ and $ k_{5}= k_{1}$ the circles $ k_{i}$ and $ k_{i+1}$ meet at $ A_{i}$ and $ B_{i}$ such that $ A_{i}$ lies on $ k$. The points $ O_{1},A_{1},O_{2},A_{2},O_{3},A_{3},O_{4},A_{4}$ lie in that order on $ k$ and are pairwise different.

Prove that $ B_{1}B_{2}B_{3}B_{4}$ is a rectangle.
