There are $n$ boys and $n$ girls in a school class, where $n$ is a positive integer. The heights of all the children in this class are distinct. Every girl determines the number of boys that are taller than her, subtracts the number of girls that are taller than her, and writes the result on a piece of paper. Every boy determines the number of girls that are shorter than him, subtracts the number of boys that are shorter than him, and writes the result on a piece of paper.

Prove that the numbers written down by the girls are the same as the numbers written down by the boys (up to a permutation).
