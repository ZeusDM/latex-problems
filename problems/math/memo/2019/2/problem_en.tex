Let $n\geq 3$ be an integer. We say that a vertex $A_i (1\leq i\leq n)$ of a convex polygon $A_1A_2 \dots A_n$ is Bohemian if its reflection with respect to the midpoint of $A_{i-1}A_{i+1}$ (with $A_0=A_n$ and $A_1=A_{n+1}$) lies inside or on the boundary of the polygon $A_1A_2\dots A_n$. Determine the smallest possible number of Bohemian  vertices a convex $n$-gon can have (depending on $n$).
