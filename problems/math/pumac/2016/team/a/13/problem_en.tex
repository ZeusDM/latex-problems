Ayase randomly picks a number $x \in (0, 1]$ with uniform probability. He then draws the six points $(0, 0, 0),(x, 0, 0),(2x, 3x, 0),(5, 5, 2),(7, 3, 0),(9, 1, 4)$. If the expected value of the volume of the convex polyhedron formed by these six points can be written as $\frac{m}{n}$ for relatively prime positive integers $m$ and $n$, find $m + n$
