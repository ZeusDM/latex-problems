Let $\vartriangle ABC$ be a right triangle with $AB = 4, BC = 5$, and hypotenuse $AC$. Let I be the incenter of $\vartriangle ABC$ and $E$ be the excenter of $\vartriangle ABC$ opposite $A$ (the center of the circle tangent to $BC$ and the extensions of segments $AB$ and $AC$). Suppose the circle with diameter $IE$ intersects line $AB$ beyond $B$ at $D$. If $BD =\sqrt{a}- b$, where a and b are positive integers. Find $a + b$.
