An alphabet $A$ has $16$ letters. A message is written using the alphabet and, to encrypt the message, a permutation $f : A \to A$ is applied to each letter. Let $n(f)$ be the smallest positive integer $k$ such that every message $m$, encrypted by applying $f$ to the message $k$ times, produces $m$. Compute the largest possible value of $n(f)$.
