In triangle $ABC$, let $S$ be on $BC$ and $T$ be on $AC$ so that $AS  \perp BC$ and $BT \perp AC$, and let $AS$ and $BT$ intersect at $H$. Let $O$ be the center of the circumcircle of $\vartriangle AHT, P$ be the center of the circumcircle of $\vartriangle BHS$, and $G$ be the other point of intersection (besides $H$) of the two circles. Let $GH$ and $OP$ intersect at $X$. If $AB = 14, BH = 6$, and HA = 11, then $XO - XP$ can be written in simplest form as $\frac{m}{n}$ . Find $m + n$.
