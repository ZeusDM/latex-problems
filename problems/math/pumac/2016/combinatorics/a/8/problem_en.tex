Katie Ledecky and Michael Phelps each participate in $7$ swimming events in the Olympics (and there is no event that they both participate in). Ledecky receives $g_L$ gold, $s_L$ silver, and $b_L$ bronze medals, and Phelps receives $g_P$ gold, $s_P$ silver, and $b_P$ bronze medals. Ledecky notices that she performed objectively better than Phelps: for all positive real numbers $w_b<w_s<w_g$, we have
$$w_gg_l+w_ss_L+w_bb_L>w_gg_P+w_ss_P+w_bb_P.$$Compute the number of possible $6$-tuples $(g_L,s_L,b_L,g_P,s_P,b_P).$
