A knight is placed at the origin of the Cartesian plane. Each turn, the knight moves in an chess $\text{L}$-shape ($2$ units parallel to one axis and $1$ unit parallel to the other) to one of eight possible location, chosen at random. After $2016$ such turns, what is the expected value of the square of the distance of the knight from the origin?
