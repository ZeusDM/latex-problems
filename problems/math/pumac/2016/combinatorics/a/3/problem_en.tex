Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Emma, and Fred sit in a circle, in that order, and each roll a six-sided die. Each person looks at his or her own roll, and also looks at the roll of either the person to the right or to the left, deciding at random. Then, at the same time, Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, Emma and Fred each state the expected sum of the dice rolls based on the information they have. All six people say different numbers; in particular, Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Diana say $19$, $22$, $21$, and $23$, respectively. Compute the product of the dice rolls.
