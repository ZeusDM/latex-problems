The Dinky is a train connecting Princeton to the outside world. It runs on an odd schedule: the train arrive once every one-hour block at some uniformly random time (once at a random time between $\text{9am}$ and $\text{10am}$, once at a random time between $\text{10am}$ and $\text{11am}$, and so on). One day, Emilia arrives at the station, at some uniformly random time, and does not know the time. She expects to wait for $y$ minutes for the next train to arrive. After waiting for an hour, a train has still not come. She now expects to wait for $z$ minutes. Find $yz$.
