$32$ teams, ranked $1$ through $32$, enter a basketball tournament that works as follows: the teams are randomly paired and in each pair, the team that loses is out of the competition. The remaining $16$ teams are randomly paired, and so on, until there is a winner. A higher ranked team always wins against a lower-ranked team. If the probability that the team ranked $3$ (the third-best team) is one of the last four teams remaining can be written in simplest form as $\dfrac{m}{n}$, compute $m+n$.
