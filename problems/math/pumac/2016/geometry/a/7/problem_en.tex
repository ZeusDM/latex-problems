Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral with circumcircle $\omega$ and let $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $X$. Let the line through $A$ parallel to $BD$ intersect line $CD$ at $E$ and $\omega$  at $Y \ne A$. If $AB = 10, AD = 24, XA = 17$, and $XB = 21$, then the area of $\vartriangle DEY$ can be written in simplest form as $\frac{m}{n}$ . Find $m + n$.
