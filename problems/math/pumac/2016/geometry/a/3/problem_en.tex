Let $C$ be a right circular cone with apex $A$. Let $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ and $P_5$ be points placed evenly along the circular base in that order, so that $P_1P_2P_3P_4P_5$ is a regular pentagon. Suppose that the shortest path from $P_1$ to $P_3$ along the curved surface of the cone passes through the midpoint of $AP_2$. Let $h$ be the height of $C$, and $r$ be the radius of the circular base of $C$. If $\left(\frac{h}{r}\right)^2$ can be written in simplest form as $\frac{a}{b}$ , find $a + b$.
