Let $ABCD$ be a square with side length $8$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$ and let  $\omega$ be the circle passing through $M, A$, and $D$. Let $O$ be the center of $\omega, X$ be the intersection point (besides A) of $\omega$ with $AB$, and $Y$ be the intersection point of $OX$ and $AM$. If the length of $OY$ can be written in simplest form as $\frac{m}{n}$ , compute $m + n$.
