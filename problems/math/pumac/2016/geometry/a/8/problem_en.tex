Let $\vartriangle ABC$ have side lengths $AB = 4,BC = 6,CA = 5$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$ and let $P$ be the point on the circumcircle of $\vartriangle ABC$ such that $\angle MPA = 90^o$. Let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $B$ to $AC$, and let $E$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$ to $AB$. Let $PD$ and $PE$ intersect line $BC$ at $X$ and $Y$ , respectively. Compute the square of the area of $\vartriangle AXY$ .
