Let  $\vartriangle ABC$ be an equilateral triangle with side length $1$ and let $\Gamma$ the circle tangent to $AB$ and $AC$ at $B$ and $C$, respectively. Let $P$ be on side $AB$ and $Q$ be on side $AC$ so that $PQ // BC$, and the circle through $A, P$, and $Q$ is tangent to  $\Gamma$ . If the area of $\vartriangle APQ$ can be written in the form $\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$, where $a$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, find $a + b$.
