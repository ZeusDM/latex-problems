Frankie the Frog starts his morning at the origin in $\mathbb{R}^2$. He decides to go on a leisurely stroll, consisting of $3^1+3^{10}+3^{11}+3^{100}+3^{111}+3^{1000}$ moves, starting with the first move. On the $n$th move, he hops a distance of$$\max\{k\in\mathbb{Z}:3^k|n\}+1,$$then turns $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise. What is the square of the distance from his final position to the origin?
