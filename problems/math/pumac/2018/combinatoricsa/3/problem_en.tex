Alex starts at the origin $O$ of a hexagonal lattice. Every second, he moves to one of the six vertices adjacent to the vertex he is currently at. If he ends up at $X$ after $2018$ moves, then let $p$ be the probability that the shortest walk from $O$ to $X$ (where a valid move is from a vertex to an adjacent vertex) has length $2018$. Then $p$ can be expressed as $\tfrac{a^m-b}{c^n}$,  where $a$,  $b$,  and $c$ are positive integers less than $10$; $a$ and $c$ are not perfect squares; and $m$ and $n$ are positive integers less than $10000$. Find $a+b+c+m+n$.
