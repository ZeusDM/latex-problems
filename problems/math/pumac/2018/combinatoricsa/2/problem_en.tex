In an election between $\text{A}$ and $\text{B}$,  during the counting of the votes, neither candidate was more than $2$ votes ahead, and the vote ended in a tie, $6$ votes to $6$ votes. Two votes for the same candidate are indistinguishable. In how many orders could the votes have been counted? One possibility is $\text{AABBABBABABA}$.
