Michael is trying to drive a bus from his home, $(0,0)$,  to school, located at $(6,6)$. There are horizontal and vertical roads at every line $x=0,1,\ldots,6$ and $y=0,1,\ldots,6$. The city has placed $6$ roadblocks on lattice point intersections $(x,y)$ with $0\leq x,y \leq 6$. Michael notices that the only path he can take that only goes up and to the right is directly up from $(0,0)$ to $(0,6)$,  and then right to $(6,6)$. How many sets of $6$ locations could the city have blocked?
