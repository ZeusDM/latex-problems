A $2$-by-$2018$ grid is completely covered by non-overlapping L-tiles (see diagram below) and $1$-by-$1$ squares. If the L-tiles can be rotated and flipped, there are a total of $M$ such tilings.[asy]

size(1cm);

draw((0,0)--(2,0)--(2,1)--(1,1)--(1,2)--(0,2)--cycle);

draw((0,1)--(1,1)--(1,0));

What is $\ln M?$

Give your answer as an integer or decimal. If your answer is $A$ and the correct answer is $C$,  then your score will be $\max\{\lfloor7.5-\tfrac{|A-C|^{1.5}}{20}\rfloor,0\}.$
