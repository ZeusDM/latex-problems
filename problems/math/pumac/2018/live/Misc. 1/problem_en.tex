Consider all cubic polynomials $f(x)$ such that $f(2018)=2018$,  the graph of $f$ intersects the $y$-axis at height $2018$,  the coefficients of $f$ sum to $2018$,  and $f(2019)>(2018)$.

We define the infinimum of a set $S$ as follows. Let $L$ be the set of lower bounds of $S$. That is, $\ell\in L$ if and only if for all $s\in S$,  $\ell\leq s$. Then the infinimum of $S$ is $\max(L)$.

Of all such $f(x)$,  what is the infinimum of the leading coefficient (the coefficient of the $x^3$ term)?
