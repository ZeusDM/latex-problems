Andrew starts with the $2018$-tuple of binary digits $(0,0,\dots,0)$. On each turn, he randomly chooses one index (between $1$ and $2018$) and flips the digit at that index (makes it $1$ if it was a $0$ and vice versa). What is the smallest $k$ such that, after $k$ steps, the expected number of ones in the sequence is greater than $1008?$

You must give your answer as a nonnegative integer. If your answer is $A$ and the correct answer is $C$,  then your score will be $\max\{\lfloor18.5-\tfrac{|A-C|^{1.8}}{40}\rfloor,0\}.$
