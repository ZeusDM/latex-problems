Let $ABC$ be a triangle. Construct three circles $k_1$,  $k_2$,  and $k_3$ with the same radius such that they intersect each other at a common point $O$ inside the triangle $ABC$ and $k_1\cap k_2=\{A,O\}$,  $k_2 \cap k_3=\{B,O\}$,  $k_3\cap k_1=\{C,O\}$. Let $t_a$ be a common tangent of circles $k_1$ and $k_2$ such that $A$ is closer to $t_a$ than $O$. Define $t_b$ and $t_c$ similarly. Those three tangents determine a triangle $MNP$ such that the triangle $ABC$ is inside the triangle $MNP$. Prove that the area of $MNP$ is at least $9$ times the area of $ABC$.
