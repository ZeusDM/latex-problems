We say that the prime numbers $p_1,\dots,p_n$ construct the graph $G$ if we can assign to each vertex of $G$ a natural number whose prime divisors are among $p_1,\dots,p_n$ and there is an edge between two vertices in $G$ if and only if the numbers assigned to the two vertices have a common divisor greater than $1$. What is the minimal $n$ such that there exist prime numbers $p_1,\dots,p_n$ which construct any graph $G$ with $N$ vertices?
