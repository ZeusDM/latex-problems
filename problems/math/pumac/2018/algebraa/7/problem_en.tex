Let the sequence $\left \{ a_n \right \}_{n = -2}^\infty$ satisfy $a_{-1} = a_{-2} = 0, a_0 = 1$,  and for all non-negative integers $n$, $$n^2 = \sum_{k = 0}^n a_{n - k}a_{k - 1} + \sum_{k = 0}^n a_{n - k}a_{k - 2}$$Given $a_{2018}$ is rational, find the maximum integer $m$ such that $2^m$ divides the denominator of the reduced form of $a_{2018}$.
