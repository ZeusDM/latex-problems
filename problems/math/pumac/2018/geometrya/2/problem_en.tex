Let $\overline{AD}$ be a diameter of a circle. Let point $B$ be on the circle, point $C$ on $\overline{AD}$ such that $A, B, C$ form a right triangle at $C$. The value of the hypotenuse of the triangle is $4$ times the square root of its area. If $\overline{BC}$ has length $30$,  what is the length of the radius of the circle?
