Let triangle $ABC$ have $\angle BAC = 45^{\circ}$ and circumcircle $\Gamma$ and let $M$ be the intersection of the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ with $\Gamma$. Let $\Omega$ be the circle tangent to segments $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$ and internally tangent to $\Gamma$ at point $T$. Given that $\angle TMA = 45^{\circ}$ and that $TM = \sqrt{100 - 50 \sqrt{2}}$,  the length of $BC$ can be written as $a \sqrt{b}$,  where $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $a + b$.
