Let $\triangle ABC$ satisfy $AB = 17, AC = \frac{70}{3}$ and $BC = 19$. Let $I$ be the incenter of $\triangle ABC$ and $E$ be the excenter of $\triangle ABC$ opposite $A$. (Note: this means that the circle tangent to ray $AB$ beyond $B$,  ray $AC$ beyond $C$,  and side $BC$ is centered at $E$.) Suppose the circle with diameter $IE$ intersects $AB$ beyond $B$ at $D$. If $BD = \frac{a}{b}$ where $a, b$ are coprime positive integers, find $a + b$.
