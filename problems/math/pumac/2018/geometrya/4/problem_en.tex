Triangle $ABC$ has $\angle{A}=90^\circ$,  $\angle{C}=30^\circ$,  and $AC=12$. Let the circumcircle of this triangle

be $W$. Define $D$ to be the point on arc $BC$ not containing $A$ so that $\angle{CAD}=60^\circ$. Define

points $E$ and $F$ to be the foots of the perpendiculars from $D$ to lines $AB$ and $AC$,  respectively.

Let $J$ be the intersection of line $EF$ with $W$,  where $J$ is on the minor arc $AC$. The line $DF$

intersects $W$ at $H$ other than $D$. The area of the triangle $FHJ$ is in the form $\frac{a}{b}(\sqrt{c}-\sqrt{d})$

for positive integers $a,b,c,d,$ where $a,b$ are relatively prime, and the sum of $a,b,c,d$ is minimal.

Find $a+b+c+d$.
