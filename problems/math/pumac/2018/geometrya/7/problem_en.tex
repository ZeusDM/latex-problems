Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram such that $AB = 35$ and $BC = 28$. Suppose that $BD \perp BC$. Let $\ell_1$ be the reflection of $AC$ across the angle bisector of $\angle BAD$,  and let $\ell_2$ be the line through $B$ perpendicular to $CD$. $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ intersect at a point $P$. If $PD$ can be expressed in simplest form as $\frac{m}{n}$,  find $m + n$.
