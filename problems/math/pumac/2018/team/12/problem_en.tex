In right triangle $\triangle{ABC}$,  a square $WXYZ$ is inscribed such that vertices $W$ and $X$ lie on hypotenuse $\overline{AB}$,  vertex $Y$ lies on leg $\overline{BC}$,  and vertex $Z$ lies on leg $\overline{CA}$. Let $\overline{AY}$ and $\overline{BZ}$ intersect at some point $P$. If the length of each side of square $WXYZ$ is $4$,  the length of the hypotenuse $\overline{AB}$ is $60$,  and the distance between point $P$ and point $G$,  where $G$ denotes the centroid of $\triangle{ABC}$,  is $\tfrac{a}{b}$,  compute the value of $a+b$.
