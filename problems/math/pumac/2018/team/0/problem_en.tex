For each problem, you will be asked to submit two integers. The first value that you submit represents what you think the correct answer to the problem is. The second value that you submit represents how many teams you think will submit the correct answer. For example, consider

0. What is $32\div 2 \times 4 +3?$

The correct answer would be $67$. If you think every team will get it right, you should submit the number of teams competing at PUMaC. Therefore, a viable submission for the first entry could be $67$ and $n$ for the second, where $n$ is the number of teams taking the team round.

There are $\mathbf{72}$ teams signed up to take this round at PUMaC: 45 in A division and 27 in B division. You will receive $\left(\min\left(\tfrac{a}{b},\tfrac{b}{a}\right)\right)^2$ points for your guess, where $a$ is the number of teams that correctly answered the question and $b$ is the number of teams you guessed would get it correct (Note that in the case that no teams answer correctly or you guess $0$,  you will receive $0$ points).
