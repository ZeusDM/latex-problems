Aaron the Ant is somewhere on the exterior of a hollow cube of side length $2$ inches, and Fred the Flea is on the inside, at one of the vertices. At some instant, Fred flies in a straight line towards the opposite vertex, and simultaneously Aaron begins crawling on the exterior of the cube towards that same vertex. Fred moves at $\sqrt{3}$ inches per second and Aaron moves at $\sqrt{2}$ inches per second. If Aaron arrives before Fred, the area of the surface on the cube from which Aaron could have started can be written as $a\pi+\sqrt{b}+c$ where $a$,  $b$,  and $c$ are integers. Find $a+b+c.$
