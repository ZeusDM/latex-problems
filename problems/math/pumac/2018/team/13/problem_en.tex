Consider a 10-dimensional \(10 \times 10 \times \cdots \times 10 \) cube consisting of \(10^{10}\) unit cubes, such that one cube \(A\) is centered at the origin, and one cube \(B\) is centered at \((9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9)\). Paint \(A\) red and remove \(B\),  leaving an empty space. Let a move consist of taking a cube adjacent to the empty space and placing it into the empty space, leaving the space originally contained by the cube empty. What is the minimum number of moves required to result in a configuration where the cube centered at \((9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9)\) is red?
