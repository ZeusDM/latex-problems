The point $M$ is inside the tetrahedron $ABCD$ and the intersection points of the lines $AM,BM,CM$ and $DM$ with the opposite walls are denoted with $A_1,B_1,C_1,D_1$ respectively. It is given also that the ratios $\frac{MA}{MA_1}$, $\frac{MB}{MB_1}$, $\frac{MC}{MC_1}$, and $\frac{MD}{MD_1}$ are equal to the same number $k$. Find all possible values of $k$.
