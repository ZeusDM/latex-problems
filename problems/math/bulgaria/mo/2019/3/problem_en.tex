Find all real numbers $a,$ which satisfy the following condition:

For every sequence  $a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots$ of pairwise different positive integers, for which the inequality $a_n\leq an$ holds for every positive integer $n,$ there exist infinitely many numbers in the sequence with sum of their digits in base $4038,$ which is not divisible by $2019.$
