The sequence $a_1,a_2,a_3\ldots $, consisting of natural numbers, is defined by the rule:
\[a_{n+1}=a_{n}+2t(n)\]
for every natural number $n$, where $t(n)$ is the number of the different divisors of $n$ (including $1$ and $n$). Is it possible that two consecutive members of the sequence are squares of natural numbers?
