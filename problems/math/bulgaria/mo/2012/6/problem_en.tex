We are given an acute-angled triangle $ABC$ and a random point $X$ in its interior, different from the centre of the circumcircle $k$ of the triangle. The lines $AX,BX$ and $CX$ intersect $k$ for a second time in the points $A_1,B_1$ and $C_1$ respectively. Let $A_2,B_2$ and $C_2$ be the points that are symmetric of  $A_1,B_1$ and $C_1$ in respect to $BC,AC$ and $AB$ respectively. Prove that the circumcircle of the triangle $A_2,B_2$ and $C_2$ passes through a constant point that does not depend on the choice of $X$.
