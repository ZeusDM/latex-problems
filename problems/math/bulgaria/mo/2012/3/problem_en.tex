We are given a real number $a$, not equal to $0$ or $1$. Sacho and Deni play the following game. First is Sasho and then Deni and so on (they take turns). On each turn, a player changes one of the “*” symbols in the equation:
\[*x^4+*x^3+*x^2+*x^1+*=0\]
with a number of the type $a^n$, where $n$ is a whole number. Sasho wins if at the end the equation has no real roots, Deni wins otherwise. Determine (in term of $a$) who has a winning strategy
