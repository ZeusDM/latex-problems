Prove that the natural numbers can be divided into two groups in a way that both conditions are fulfilled:
1) For every prime number $p$ and every natural number $n$, the numbers $p^n,p^{n+1}$ and $p^{n+2}$ do not have the same colour.
2) There does not exist an infinite geometric sequence of natural numbers of the same colour.
