Let $X$ be a set of $n + 1$ elements, $n\geq 2$. Ordered $n$-tuples $(a_1,\ldots,a_n)$ and $(b_1,\ldots,b_n)$ formed from distinct elements of $X$ are called\textit{ disjoint }if there exist distinct indices $1\leq i \neq j\leq n$ such that $a_i = b_j$. Find the maximal number of pairwise disjoint $n$-tuples.
