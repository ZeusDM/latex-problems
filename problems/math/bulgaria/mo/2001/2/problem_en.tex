Suppose that $ABCD$ is a parallelogram such that $DAB>90$. Let the point $H$ to be on $AD$ such that $BH$ is perpendicular to $AD$. Let the point $M$ to be the midpoint of $AB$. Let the point $K$ to be the intersecting point of the line $DM$ with the circumcircle of $ADB$. Prove that $HKCD$ is concyclic.
