(a) Prove that the area of a given convex quadrilateral is at least twice the area of an arbitrary convex quadrilateral inscribed in it whose sides are parallel to the diagonals of the original one.
(b) A tetrahedron with surface area $S$ is intersected by a plane perpendicular to two opposite edges. If the area of the cross-section is $Q$, prove that $S>4Q$.
