A Pythagorean triangle is any right-angled triangle for which the lengths of two legs and the length of the hypotenuse are integers. We are observing all Pythagorean triangles in which may be inscribed a quadrangle with sidelength integer number, two of which sides lie on the cathets and one of the vertices of which lies on the hypotenuse of the triangle given. Find the side lengths of the triangle with minimal surface from the observed triangles.
