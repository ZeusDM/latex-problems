Let $M$ be a point on the altitude $CD$ of an acute-angled triangle $ABC$, and $K$ and $L$ the orthogonal projections of $M$ on $AC$ and $BC$. Suppose that the incenter and circumcenter of the triangle lie on the segment $KL$.

(a) Prove that $CD=R+r$, where $R$ and $r$ are the circumradius and inradius, respectively.
(b) Find the minimum value of the ratio $CM:CD$.
