Let $K$ be a cube with edge $n$, where $n>2$ is an even integer. Cube $K$ is divided into $n^3$ unit cubes. We call any set of $n^2$ unit cubes lying on the same horizontal or vertical level a layer. We dispose of $\frac{n^3}4$ colors, in each of which we paint exactly $4$ unit cubes. Prove that we can always select $n$ unit cubes of distinct colors, no two of which lie on the same layer.
