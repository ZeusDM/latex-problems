Let $M$ be the set of the integer numbers from the range $[-n, n]$. The subset $P$ of $M$ is called a \textit{base subset} if every number from $M$ can be expressed as a sum of some different numbers from $P$. Find the smallest natural number $k$ such that every $k$ numbers that belongs to $M$ form a base subset.
