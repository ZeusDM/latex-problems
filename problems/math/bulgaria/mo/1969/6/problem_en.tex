It is given that $r=\left(3\left(\sqrt6-1\right)-4\left(\sqrt3+1\right)+5\sqrt2\right)R$ where $r$ and $R$ are the radii of the inscribed and circumscribed spheres in a regular $n$-angled pyramid. If it is known that the centers of the spheres given coincide,

(a) find $n$;
(b) if $n=3$ and the lengths of all edges are equal to a find the volumes of the parts from the pyramid after drawing a plane $\mu$, which intersects two of the edges passing through point $A$ respectively in the points $E$ and $F$ in such a way that $|AE|=p$ and $|AF|=q$ $(p<a,q<a)$, intersects the extension of the third edge behind opposite of the vertex $A$ wall in the point $G$ in such a way that $|AG|=t$ $(t>a)$.
