Some of the points in the plane are white and some are blue (every point of the plane is either white or blue). Prove that for every positive number $r$:

(a) there are at least two points with different color such that the distance between them is equal to $r$;
(b) there are at least two points with the same color and the distance between them is equal to $r$;
(c) will the statements above be true if the plane is replaced with the real line?
