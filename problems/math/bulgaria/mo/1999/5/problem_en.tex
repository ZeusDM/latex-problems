The vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\) of an acute-angled triangle \(ABC\) lie on the sides \(B_1C_1\), \(C_1A_1\), \(A_1B_1\), respectively, of a triangle \(A_1B_1C_1\) similar to the triangle \(ABC\), i.e., \(\angle A = \angle A_1\), \(\angle B = \angle B_1\), and \(\angle C = \angle C_1\).
Prove that the orthocenters of triangles \(ABC\) and \(A_1B_1C_1\) are equidistant from the circumcenter of \(ABC\).
