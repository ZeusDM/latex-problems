Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle $k$. $AC$ and $BD$ meet at $E$. The rays $\overrightarrow{CB}, \overrightarrow{DA}$ meet at $F$.
Prove that the line through the incenters of $\triangle ABE\,,\, \triangle ABF$ and the line through the incenters of $\triangle CDE\,,\, \triangle CDF$ meet at a point lying on the circle $k$.
