Every cell of a $m \times n$ chess board, $m\ge 2,n\ge 2$, is colored with one of four possible colors, e.g white, green, red, blue. We call such coloring good if the four cells of any $2\times 2$ square of the chessboard are colored with pairwise different colors. Determine the number of all good colorings of the chess board.
