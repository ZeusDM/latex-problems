Let $\triangle {ABC} $ be isosceles triangle with $AC=BC$ . The point $D$ lies on the extension of $AC$ beyond $C$ and is that $AC>CD$. The angular bisector of $ \angle BCD $ intersects $BD$ at point $N$ and let $M$ be the midpoint of $BD$. The tangent at $M$ to the circumcircle of triangle $AMD$ intersects the side $BC$ at point $P$. Prove that points $A,P,M$ and $N$ lie on a circle.
