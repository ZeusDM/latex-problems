Given a polynomial $P(x)=a_{d}x^{d}+ \ldots +a_{2}x^{2}+a_{0}$ with positive integers for coefficients and degree $d\geq 2$. Consider the sequence defined by $$b_{1}=a_{0} ,b_{n+1}=P(b_{n}) $$for $n \geq 1$ . Prove that for all $n \geq 2$ there exists a prime $p$ such that $p$ divides $b_{n}$ but does not divide $b_{1}b_{2} \ldots b_{n-1}$.
