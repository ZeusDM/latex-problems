Let $H$ be an arbitrary point on the altitude $CP$ of the acute triangle $ABC$. The lines $AH$ and $BH$ intersect $BC$ and $AC$ in $M$ and $N$, respectively.
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
  \item Prove that $\angle NPC =\angle MPC$.
  \item Let $O$ be the common point of $MN$ and $CP$. An arbitrary line through $O$ meets the sides of quadrilateral $CNHM$ in $D$ and $E$. Prove that $\angle EPC =\angle DPC$.
\end{enumerate}
