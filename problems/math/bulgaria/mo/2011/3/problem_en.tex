Triangle $ABC$ and a function $f:\mathbb{R}^+\to\mathbb{R}$ have the following property: for every line segment $DE$ from the interior of the triangle with midpoint $M$, the inequality $f(d(D))+f(d(E))\le 2f(d(M))$, where $d(X)$ is the distance from point $X$ to the nearest side of the triangle ($X$ is in the interior of $\triangle ABC$). Prove that for each line segment $PQ$ and each point interior point $N$ the inequality $|QN|f(d(P))+|PN|f(d(Q))\le |PQ|f(d(N))$ holds.
