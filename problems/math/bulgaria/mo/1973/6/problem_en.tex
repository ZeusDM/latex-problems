In the tetrahedron $ABCD$, $E$ and $F$ are the midpoints of $BC$ and $AD$, $G$ is the midpoint of the segment $EF$. Construct a plane through $G$ intersecting the segments $AB$, $AC$, $AD$ in the points $M,N,P$ respectively in such a way that the sum of the volumes of the tetrahedrons $BMNP$, $CMNP$ and $DMNP$ to be minimal.
