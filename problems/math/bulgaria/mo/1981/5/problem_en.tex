Find all positive values of $a$, for which there is a number $b$ such that the parabola $y=ax^2-b$ intersects the unit circle at four distinct points. Also prove that for every such a there exists $b$ such that the parabola $y=ax^2-b$ intersects the unit circle at four distinct points whose $x$-coordinates form an arithmetic progression.
