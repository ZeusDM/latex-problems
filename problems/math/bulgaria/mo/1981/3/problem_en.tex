A quadrilateral pyramid is cut by a plane parallel to the base. Suppose that a sphere $S$ is circumscribed and a sphere $\Sigma$ inscribed in the obtained solid, and moreover that the line through the centers of these two spheres is perpendicular to the base of the pyramid. Show that the pyramid is regular.
