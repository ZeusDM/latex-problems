It is given a tetrahedron $ABCD$ for which two points of opposite edges are mutually perpendicular. Prove that:

(a) the four altitudes of $ABCD$ intersects at a common point $H$;
(b) $AH+BH+CH+DH<p+2R$, where $p$ is the sum of the lengths of all edges of $ABCD$ and $R$ is the radii of the sphere circumscribed around $ABCD$.
