It is given the equation $x^2+px+1=0$, with roots $x_1$ and $x_2$;

(a) find a second-degree equation with roots $y_1,y_2$ satisfying the conditions $y_1=x_1(1-x_1)$, $y_2=x_2(1-x_2)$;
(b) find all possible values of the real parameter $p$ such that the roots of the new equation lies between $-2$ and $1$.
