Point $S$ is the midpoint of arc $ACB$ of the circumscribed circle $k$ around triangle $ABC$ with $AC>BC$. Let $I$ be the incenter of triangle $ABC$. Line $SI$ intersects $k$ again at point $T$. Let $D$ be the reflection of $I$ across $T$ and $M$ be the midpoint of side $AB$. Line $IM$ intersects the line through $D$, parallel to $AB$, at point $E$. Prove that $AE=BD$.
