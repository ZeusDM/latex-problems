A point $T$ is given on the altitude through point $C$ in the acute triangle $ABC$ with circumcenter $O$, such that $\measuredangle TBA=\measuredangle ACB$. If the line $CO$ intersects side $AB$ at point $K$, prove that the perpendicular bisector of $AB$, the altitude through $A$ and the segment $KT$ are concurrent.
