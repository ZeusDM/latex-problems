Let $a_1<a_2<a_3<\cdots$ and $b_1<b_2<b_3<\cdots$ be two infinite arithmetic sequences with positive integers.
It is known that there are infinitely many pairs of positive integers $(i,j)$ for which $i\leq j\leq i+2021$ and $a_i$ divides $b_j$.
Prove that for every positive integer $i$ there exists a positive integer $j$ such that $a_i$ divides $b_j$.
