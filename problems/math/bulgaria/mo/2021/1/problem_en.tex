A city has $4$ horizontal and $n\geq3$ vertical boulevards  which intersect at $4n$ crossroads.
The crossroads divide every horizontal boulevard into $n-1$ streets and every vertical boulevard into $3$ streets.
The mayor of the city decides to close the minimum possible number of crossroads so that the city doesn't have a closed path, i.e., this means that starting from any street and going only through open crossroads without turning back you can't return to the same street.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item Prove that exactly $n$ crossroads are closed.
	\item Prove that if from any street you can go to any other street and none of the $4$ corner crossroads are closed then exactly $3$ crossroads on the border are closed.
	  (A crossroad is on the border if it lies either on the first or fourth horizontal boulevard, or on the first or the \(n\)-th vertical boulevard.)
\end{enumerate}
