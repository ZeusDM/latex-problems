In triangle $ABC$, point $O$ is the center of the excircle touching the side $BC$, while the other two excircles touch the sides $AB$ and $AC$ at points $M$ and $N$ respectively. A line through $O$ perpendicular to $MN$ intersects the line $BC$ at $P$. Determine the ratio $AB/AC$, given that the ratio of the area of $\triangle ABC$ to the area of $\triangle MNP$ is $2R/r$, where $R$ is the circumradius and $r$ the inradius of $\triangle ABC$.
