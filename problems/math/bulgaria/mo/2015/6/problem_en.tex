In a mathematical olympiad students received marks for any of the four areas: algebra, geometry, number theory and combinatorics. Any two of the students have distinct marks for all four areas. A group of students is called \textit{nice } if all students in the group can be ordered in increasing order simultaneously of at least two of the four areas. Find the least positive integer N, such that among any N students there exist a \textit{nice } group of ten students.
