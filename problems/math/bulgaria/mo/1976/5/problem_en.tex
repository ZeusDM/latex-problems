It is given a tetrahedron $ABCD$ and a plane $\alpha$ intersecting the three edges passing through $D$. Prove that $\alpha$ divides the surface of the tetrahedron into two parts proportional to the volumes of the bodies formed if and only if $\alpha$ is passing through the center of the inscribed tetrahedron sphere.
