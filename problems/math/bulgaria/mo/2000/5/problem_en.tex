Let $D$ be the midpoint of the base $AB$ of the isosceles acute triangle $ABC$. Choose point $E$ on segment $AB$, and let $O$ be the circumcenter of triangle $ACE$. Prove that the line through $D$ perpendicular to $DO$, the line through $E$ perpendicular to $BC$, and the line through $B$ parallel to $AC$ are concurrent.
