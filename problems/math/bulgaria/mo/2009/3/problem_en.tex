Through the points with integer coordinates in the right-angled coordinate system $Oxyz$ are constructed planes, parallel to the coordinate planes and in this way the space is divided to unit cubes. Find all triples ($a, b, c$) consisting of natural numbers ($a \le  b \le c$) for which the cubes formed can be coloured in $abc$ colors in such a way that every palellepiped with  dimensions $a \times  b \times c$, having vertices with integer coordinates and sides parallel to the coordinate axis doesn't contain unit cubes in the same color.
