Let $f(x)$ be a non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients and $n,k$ be natural numbers. Show that there exist $n$ consecutive natural numbers $a,a+1,\ldots,a+n-1$ such that the numbers $f(a),f(a+1),\ldots,f(a+n-1)$ all have at least $k$ prime factors. (We say that the number $p_1^{\alpha_1}\cdots p_s^{\alpha_s}$ has $\alpha_1+\ldots+\alpha_s$ prime factors.)
