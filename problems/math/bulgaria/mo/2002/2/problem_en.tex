Consider the orthogonal projections of the vertices $A$, $B$ and $C$ of triangle $ABC$ on external bisectors of $ \angle ACB$, $ \angle BAC$ and $ \angle ABC$, respectively. Prove that if $d$ is the diameter of the circumcircle of the triangle, which is formed by the feet of projections, while $r$ and $p$ are the inradius and the semiperimeter of triangle $ABC$, prove that $r^2+p^2=d^2$
