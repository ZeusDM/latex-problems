Let $I$ be the incenter of a non-equilateral triangle $ABC$ and $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$ be the tangency points of the incircle with the sides $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$, respectively. Prove that the orthocenter of triangle $T_1T_2T_3$ lies on the line $OI$, where $O$ is the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$.
