Each of two different lines parallel to the the axis $Ox$ have exactly two common points on the graph of the function $f(x)=x^3+ax^2+bx+c$. Let $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ be two lines parallel to $Ox$ axis which meet the graph of $f$ in points $K_1, K_2$ and $K_3, K_4$, respectively. Prove that the quadrilateral formed by $K_1, K_2, K_3$ and $ K_4$ is a rhombus if and only if its area is equal to $6$ units.
