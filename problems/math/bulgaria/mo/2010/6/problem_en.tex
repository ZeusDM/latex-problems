Let $k$ be the circumference of the triangle $ABC.$ The point $D$ is an arbitrary point on the segment $AB.$ Let $I$ and $J$ be the centers of the circles which are tangent to the side $AB,$ the segment $CD$ and the circle $k.$ We know that the points $A, B, I$ and $J$ are concyclic. The excircle of the triangle $ABC$  is tangent to the side $AB$ in the point $M.$ Prove that $M \equiv D.$
