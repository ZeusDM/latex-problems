Let $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_9$ and $b_1 , b_2, \ldots,b_9$ be positive integers such that $a_9<b_9$ and $a_k \neq b_k, 1 \leq k \leq 8.$ In a cash dispenser/automated teller machine/ATM there are $n\geq a_9$ levs (Bulgarian national currency) and for each $1 \leq i \leq 9$ we can take $a_i$ levs from the ATM  (if in the bank there are at least $a_i$ levs).  Immediately after that action the bank puts $b_i$ levs in the ATM or we take $a_0$ levs. If we take $a_0$ levs from the ATM the bank doesnâ€™t put any money in the ATM. Find all possible positive integer values of $n$ such that after finite number of takings money from the ATM there will be no money in it.
