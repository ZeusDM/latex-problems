Let $M$ be a set of $2017$ positive integers.
For any subset \(A\) of \(M\), let \(f(A)\) be the set of all \(x \in M\) such that \(|\{y \in A : x\text{ is a multiple of }y\}|\) is odd.
Find the minimal natural number $k$, satisfying that, for any $M$, we can color all the subsets of $M$ with $k$ colors, such that whenever $A\neq f(A)$, $A$ and $f(A)$ are colored with different colors.
