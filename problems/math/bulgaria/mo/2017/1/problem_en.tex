An convex qudrilateral $ABCD$ is given. $O$ is the intersection point of the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$. The points $A_1,B_1,C_1, D_1$ lie respectively on $AO, BO, CO, DO$ such that $AA_1=CC_1, BB_1=DD_1$.
The circumcircles of $\triangle AOB$ and $\triangle COD$ meet at second time at $M$ and the the circumcircles of $\triangle AOD$ and $\triangle BOC$ - at $N$.
The circumcircles of $\triangle A_1OB_1$ and $\triangle C_1OD_1$ meet at second time at $P$ and the the circumcircles of $\triangle A_1OD_1$ and $\triangle B_1OC_1$ - at $Q$.
Prove that the quadrilateral $MNPQ$ is cyclic.
