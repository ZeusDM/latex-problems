Let $\Delta$ be the set of all triangles inscribed in a given circle, with angles whose measures are integer numbers of degrees different than $45^\circ,90^\circ$ and $135^\circ$. For each triangle $T\in\Delta$, $f(T)$ denotes the triangle with vertices at the second intersection points of the altitudes of $T$ with the circle.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
  \item
	Let $f^0(T)=T$ and $f^k(T)=f(f^{k-1}(T))$.
	Prove that there exists a natural number $n$ such that for every triangle $T\in\Delta$, among the triangles
	$T,\allowbreak f(T),\allowbreak \ldots,\allowbreak f^n(T)$
	at least two are equal.
	\item Find the smallest $n$ with the property above.
\end{enumerate}
