Find the smallest integer $n\ge3$ for which there exists an $n$-gon and a point within it such that, if a light bulb is placed at that point, on each side of the polygon there will be a point that is not lightened. Show that for this smallest value of $n$ there always exist two points within the $n$-gon such that the bulbs placed at these points will lighten up the whole perimeter of the $n$-gon.
