Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $AA_1$ be the angle bisector of $A$ ($A_1 \in BC$). The point $P$ is on the segment $AA_1$ and $M$ is the midpoint of the side $BC$. The point $Q$ is on the line connecting $P$ and $M$ such that $M$ is the midpoint of $PQ$. Define $D$ and $E$ as the intersections of $BQ$,  $AC$,  and $CQ$,  $AB$. Prove that $CD=BE$.
