Let $m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n$ be a collection of $n$ positive integers, not necessarily distinct. For any sequence of integers $A = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ and any permutation $w = w_1, \ldots, w_n$ of $m_1, \ldots, m_n$, define an \emph{$A$-inversion} of $w$ to be a pair of entries $w_i, w_j$ with $i < j$ for which one of the following conditions holds:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $a_i \ge w_i > w_j$
	\item $w_j > a_i \ge w_i$, or
	\item $w_i > w_j > a_i$.
\end{itemize}
Show that, for any two sequences of integers $A = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$ and $B = (b_1, \ldots, b_n)$, and for any positive integer $k$, the number of permutations of $m_1, \ldots, m_n$ having exactly $k$ $A$-inversions is equal to the number of permutations of $m_1, \ldots, m_n$ having exactly $k$ $B$-inversions.
