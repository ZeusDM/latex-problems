Let $ABC$ be a scalene triangle with circumcircle $\Omega$ and incenter $I$. Ray $AI$ meets $\overline{BC}$ at $D$ and meets $\Omega$ again at $M$; the circle with diameter $\overline{DM}$ cuts $\Omega$ again at $K$. Lines $MK$ and $BC$ meet at $S$, and $N$ is the midpoint of $\overline{IS}$. The circumcircles of $\triangle KID$ and $\triangle MAN$ intersect at points $L_1$ and $L_2$. Prove that $\Omega$ passes through the midpoint of either $\overline{IL_1}$ or $\overline{IL_2}$.
