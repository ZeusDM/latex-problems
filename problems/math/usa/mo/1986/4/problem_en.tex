Two distinct circles $K_1$ and $K_2$ are drawn in the plane. They intersect at points $A$ and $B$,  where $AB$ is the diameter of $K_1$. A point $P$ on $K_2$ and inside $K_1$ is also given.

Using only a "T-square" (i.e. an instrument which can produce a straight line joining two points and the perpendicular to a line through a point on or off the line), find a construction for two points $C$ and $D$ on $K_1$ such that $CD$ is perpendicular to $AB$ and $\angle CPD$ is a right angle.
