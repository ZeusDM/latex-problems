Six segments $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5,$ and $S_6$ are given in a plane. These are congruent to the edges $AB, AC, AD, BC, BD,$ and $CD$,  respectively, of a tetrahedron $ABCD$. Show how to construct a segment congruent to the altitude of the tetrahedron from vertex $A$ with straight-edge and compasses.
