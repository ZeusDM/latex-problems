A circle is divided into $432$ congruent arcs by $432$ points.  The points are colored in four colors such that some $108$ points are colored Red, some $108$ points are colored Green, some $108$ points are colored Blue, and the remaining $108$ points are colored Yellow.  Prove that one can choose three points of each color in such a way that the four triangles formed by the chosen points of the same color are congruent.
