The sum of the measures of all the face angles of a given complex polyhedral angle is equal to the sum of all its dihedral angles. Prove that the polyhedral angle is a trihedral angle.$\mathbf{Note:}$ A convex polyhedral angle may be formed by drawing rays from an exterior point to all points of a convex polygon.
