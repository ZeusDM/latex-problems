Let $AXYZB$ be a convex pentagon inscribed in a semicircle of diameter $AB$. Denote by$P$,  $Q$,  $R$,  $S$ the feet of the perpendiculars from $Y$ onto lines $AX$,  $BX$,  $AZ$,  $BZ$,  respectively.  Prove that the acute angle formed by lines $PQ$ and $RS$ is half the size of $\angle XOZ$,  where $O$ is the midpoint of segment $AB$.
