There are $n$ students standing in a circle, one behind the other. The students have heights $h_1<h_2<\dots <h_n$. If a student with height $h_k$ is standing directly behind a student with height $h_{k-2}$ or less, the two students are permitted to switch places. Prove that it is not possible to make more than $\binom{n}{3}$ such switches before reaching a position in which no further switches are possible.
