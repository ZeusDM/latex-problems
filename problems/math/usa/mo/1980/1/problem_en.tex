A two-pan balance is innacurate since its balance arms are of different lengths and its pans are of different weights. Three objects of different weights $A$,  $B$,  and $C$ are each weighed separately. When placed on the left-hand pan, they are balanced by weights $A_1$,  $B_1$,  and $C_1$,  respectively. When $A$ and $B$ are placed on the right-hand pan, they are balanced by $A_2$ and $B_2$,  respectively. Determine the true weight of $C$ in terms of $A_1, B_1, C_1, A_2$,  and $B_2$.
