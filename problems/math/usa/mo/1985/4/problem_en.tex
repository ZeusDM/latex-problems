There are $n$ people at a party. Prove that there are two people such that, of the remaining $n-2$ people, there are at least $\left\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\right\rfloor-1$ of them, each of whom either knows both or else knows neither of the two. Assume that knowing is a symmetric relation, and that $\lfloor x\rfloor$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.
