For a positive integer $n\geq 3$ plot $n$ equally spaced points around a circle.  Label one of them $A$,  and place a marker at $A$.  One may move the marker forward in a clockwise direction to either the next point or the point after that.  Hence there are a total of $2n$ distinct moves available; two from each point.  Let $a_n$ count the number of ways to advance around the circle exactly twice, beginning and ending at $A$,  without repeating a move.  Prove that $a_{n-1}+a_n=2^n$ for all $n\geq 4$.
