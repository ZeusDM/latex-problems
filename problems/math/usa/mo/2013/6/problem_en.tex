Let $ABC$ be a triangle.  Find all points $P$ on segment $BC$ satisfying the following property:  If $X$ and $Y$ are the intersections of line $PA$ with the common external tangent lines of the circumcircles of triangles $PAB$ and $PAC$,  then \[\left(\frac{PA}{XY}\right)^2+\frac{PB\cdot PC}{AB\cdot AC}=1.\]
