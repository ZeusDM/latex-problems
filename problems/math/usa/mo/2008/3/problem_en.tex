Let $n$ be a positive integer. Denote by $S_n$ the set of points $(x, y)$ with integer coordinates such that \[ \left\lvert x\right\rvert + \left\lvert y + \frac{1}{2} \right\rvert < n. \] A path is a sequence of distinct points $(x_1 , y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_\ell, y_\ell)$ in $S_n$ such that, for $i = 2, \ldots, \ell$,  the distance between $(x_i , y_i)$ and $(x_{i-1} , y_{i-1} )$ is $1$ (in other words, the points $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_{i-1} , y_{i-1} )$ are neighbors in the lattice of points with integer coordinates). Prove that the points in $S_n$ cannot be partitioned into fewer than $n$ paths (a partition of $S_n$ into $m$ paths is a set $\mathcal{P}$ of $m$ nonempty paths such that each point in $S_n$ appears in exactly one of the $m$ paths in $\mathcal{P}$).
