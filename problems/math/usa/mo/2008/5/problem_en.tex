Three nonnegative real numbers $ r_1$,  $ r_2$,  $ r_3$ are written on a blackboard. These numbers have the property that there exist integers $ a_1$,  $ a_2$,  $ a_3$,  not all zero, satisfying $ a_1r_1 + a_2r_2 + a_3r_3 = 0$. We are permitted to perform the following operation: find two numbers $ x$,  $ y$ on the blackboard with $ x \le y$,  then erase $ y$ and write $ y - x$ in its place. Prove that after a finite number of such operations, we can end up with at least one $ 0$ on the blackboard.
