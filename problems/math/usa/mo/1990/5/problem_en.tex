An acute-angled triangle $ABC$ is given in the plane. The circle with diameter $\, AB \,$ intersects altitude $\, CC' \,$ and its extension at points $\, M \,$ and $\, N \,$,  and the circle with diameter $\, AC \,$ intersects altitude $\, BB' \,$ and its extensions at $\, P \,$ and $\, Q \,$. Prove that the points $\, M, N, P, Q \,$ lie on a common circle.
