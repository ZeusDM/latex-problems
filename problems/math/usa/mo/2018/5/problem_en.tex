In convex cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$, we know that lines $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$, lines $AB$ and $CD$ intersect at $F$, and lines $BC$ and $DA$ intersect at $G$. Suppose that the circumcircle of $\triangle{ABE}$ intersects line $CB$ at $B$ and $P$, and the circumcircle of $\triangle{ADE}$ intersects line $CD$ at $D$ and $Q$, where $C,B,P,G$ and $C,Q,D,F$ are collinear in that order. Prove that if lines $FP$ and $GQ$ intersect at $M$, then $\angle{PAC}=90^\circ$.
