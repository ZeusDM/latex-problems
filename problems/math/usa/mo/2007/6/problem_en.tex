Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $\omega,S$,  and $R$ being its incircle, circumcircle, and circumradius, respectively. Circle $\omega_{A}$ is tangent internally to $S$ at $A$ and tangent externally to $\omega$. Circle $S_{A}$ is tangent internally to $S$ at $A$ and tangent internally to $\omega$. Let $P_{A}$ and $Q_{A}$ denote the centers of $\omega_{A}$ and $S_{A}$,  respectively. Define points $P_{B}, Q_{B}, P_{C}, Q_{C}$ analogously. Prove that\[8P_{A}Q_{A}\cdot P_{B}Q_{B}\cdot P_{C}Q_{C}\leq R^{3}\; , \]

with equality if and only if triangle $ABC$ is equilateral.
