Let $S$ be a great circle with pole $P$.  On any great circle through $P$,  two points $A$ and $B$ are chosen equidistant from $P$.  For any  spherical triangle  $ABC$ (the sides are great circles ares), where $C$ is on $S$,  prove that the great circle are $CP$ is the angle bisector of angle $C$. Note.   A great circle on a sphere is one whose center is the center of the sphere.  A pole of the great circle $S$ is a point $P$ on the sphere such that the diameter through $P$ is perpendicular to the plane of $S$.
