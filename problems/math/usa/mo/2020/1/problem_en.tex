Let $ABC$ be a fixed acute triangle inscribed in a circle $\omega$ with center $O$. A variable point $X$ is chosen on minor arc $AB$ of $\omega$, and segments $CX$ and $AB$ meet at $D$. Denote by $O_1$ and $O_2$ the circumcenters of triangles $ADX$ and $BDX$, respectively. Determine all points $X$ for which the area of triangle $OO_1O_2$ is minimized.
