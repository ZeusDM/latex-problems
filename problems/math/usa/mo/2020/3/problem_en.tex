Let $p$ be an odd prime. An integer $x$ is called a \textit{quadratic non-residue} if $p$ does not divide $x-t^2$ for any integer $t$.

Denote by $A$ the set of all integers $a$ such that $1\le a<p$, and both $a$ and $4-a$ are quadratic non-residues. Calculate the remainder when the product of the elements of $A$ is divided by $p$.
