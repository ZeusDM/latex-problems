Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral, and let $E$ and $F$ be points on sides $AD$ and $BC$,  respectively, such that $\frac{AE}{ED} = \frac{BF}{FC}$. Ray $FE$ meets rays $BA$ and $CD$ at $S$ and $T$,  respectively. Prove that the circumcircles of triangles $SAE$,  $SBF$,  $TCF$,  and $TDE$ pass through a common point.
