An equilateral pentagon $AMNPQ$ is inscribed in triangle $ABC$ such that $M\in\overline{AB}$,  $Q\in\overline{AC}$,  and $N,P\in\overline{BC}$. Let $S$ be the intersection of $\overleftrightarrow{MN}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{PQ}$. Denote by $\ell$ the angle bisector of $\angle MSQ$.

Prove that $\overline{OI}$ is parallel to $\ell$,  where $O$ is the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$,  and $I$ is the incenter of triangle $ABC$.
