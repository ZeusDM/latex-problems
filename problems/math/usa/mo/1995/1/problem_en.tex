Let $\, p \,$ be an odd prime.  The sequence $(a_n)_{n \geq 0}$ is defined as follows: $\, a_0 = 0,$ $a_1 = 1, \, \ldots, \, a_{p-2} = p-2 \,$ and, for all $\, n \geq p-1, \,$ $\, a_n \,$ is the least positive integer that does not form an arithmetic sequence of length $\, p \,$ with any of the preceding terms. Prove that, for all $\, n, \,$ $\, a_n \,$ is the number obtained by writing $\, n \,$ in base $\, p-1 \,$ and reading the result in base $\, p$.
