Given circles $ \omega_1$ and $ \omega_2$ intersecting at points $ X$ and  let $ \ell_1$ be a line through the center of $ \omega_1$ intersecting $ \omega_2$ at points $ P$ and $ Q$ and let $ \ell_2$ be a line through the center of $ \omega_2$ intersecting $ \omega_1$ at points $ R$ and   Prove that if $ P, Q, R$ and $ S$ lie on a circle then the center of this circle lies on line
