A given convex pentagon $ ABCDE$ has the property that the area of each of five triangles $ ABC, BCD, CDE, DEA$,  and $ EAB$ is unity (equal to 1). Show that all pentagons with the above property have the same area, and calculate that area. Show, furthermore, that there are infinitely many non-congruent pentagons having the above area property.
