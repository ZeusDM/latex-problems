Let $ABC$ be a triangle with orthocenter $H$ and let $P$ be the second intersection of the circumcircle of triangle $AHC$ with the internal bisector of the angle $\angle BAC$.  Let $X$ be the circumcenter of triangle $APB$ and $Y$ the orthocenter of triangle $APC$.  Prove that the length of segment $XY$ is equal to the circumradius of triangle $ABC$.
