Let ${\cal C}_1$ and ${\cal C}_2$ be  concentric circles, with ${\cal C}_2$ in the interior of  ${\cal C}_1$. From a point $A$ on ${\cal C}_1$ one draws the tangent $AB$ to ${\cal C}_2$ ($B\in {\cal C}_2$). Let $C$ be the second point of intersection of $AB$ and ${\cal C}_1$,  and let $D$ be the midpoint of $AB$. A line passing through $A$ intersects ${\cal C}_2$ at $E$ and $F$ in such a way that the perpendicular  bisectors of $DE$ and $CF$ intersect at a point $M$ on $AB$. Find, with proof,  the ratio $AM/MC$.
