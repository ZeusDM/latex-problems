A convex polygon $\mathcal{P}$ in the plane is dissected into smaller convex polygons by drawing all of its diagonals. The lengths of all sides and all diagonals of the polygon $\mathcal{P}$ are rational numbers. Prove that the lengths of all sides of all polygons in the dissection are also rational numbers.
