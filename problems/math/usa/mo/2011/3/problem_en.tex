In hexagon $ABCDEF$,  which is nonconvex but not self-intersecting, no pair of opposite sides are parallel.  The internal angles satisfy $\angle A=3\angle D$,  $\angle C=3\angle F$,  and $\angle E=3\angle B$.  Furthermore $AB=DE$,  $BC=EF$,  and $CD=FA$.  Prove that diagonals $\overline{AD}$,  $\overline{BE}$,  and $\overline{CF}$ are concurrent.
