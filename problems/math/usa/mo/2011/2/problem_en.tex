An integer is assigned to each vertex of a regular pentagon so that the sum of the five integers is 2011.  A turn of a solitaire game consists of subtracting an integer $m$ from each of the integers at two neighboring vertices and adding $2m$ to the opposite vertex, which is not adjacent to either of the first two vertices.  (The amount $m$ and the vertices chosen can vary from turn to turn.)  The game is won at a certain vertex if, after some number of turns, that vertex has the number 2011 and the other four vertices have the number 0.  Prove that for any choice of the initial integers, there is exactly one vertex at which the game can be won.
