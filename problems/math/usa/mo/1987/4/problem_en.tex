Three circles $C_i$ are given in the plane: $C_1$ has diameter $AB$ of length $1$; $C_2$ is concentric and has diameter $k$ ($1 < k < 3$); $C_3$ has center $A$ and diameter $2k$.  We regard $k$ as fixed.  Now consider all straight line segments $XY$ which have one endpoint $X$ on $C_2$,  one endpoint $Y$ on $C_3$,  and contain the point $B$.  For what ratio $XB/BY$ will the segment $XY$ have minimal length?
