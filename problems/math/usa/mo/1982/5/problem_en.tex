$A,B$,  and $C$ are three interior points of a sphere $S$ such that $AB$ and $AC$ are perpendicular to the diameter of $S$ through $A$,  and so that two spheres can be constructed through $A$,  $B$,  and $C$ which are both tangent to $S$. Prove that the sum of their radii is equal to the radius of $S$.
