If a point $A_1$ is in the interior of an equilateral triangle $ABC$ and point $A_2$ is in the interior of $\triangle{A_1BC}$,  prove that \[\operatorname{I.Q.} (A_1BC) > \operatorname{I.Q.} (A_2BC),\]where the isoperrimetric quotient of a figure $F$ is defined by \[\operatorname{I.Q.}(F) = \frac{\operatorname{Area}(F)}{[\operatorname{Perimeter}(F)]^2}.\]
