Legs $L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4$ of a square table each have  length $n$,  where $n$ is a positive integer.  For how many ordered  4-tuples $(k_1, k_2, k_3, k_4)$ of nonnegative integers can we cut  a piece of length $k_i$ from the end of leg $L_i \; (i=1,2,3,4)$ and still have a stable table?

(The table is stable if it can be placed so that  all four of the leg ends touch the floor. Note that a cut leg of length 0 is permitted.)
