Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle, and let $P$ and $Q$ be two points on its side $BC$. Construct a point $C_{1}$ in such a way that the convex quadrilateral $APBC_{1}$ is cyclic, $QC_{1}\parallel CA$,  and $C_{1}$ and $Q$ lie on opposite sides of line $AB$. Construct a point $B_{1}$ in such a way that the convex quadrilateral $APCB_{1}$ is cyclic, $QB_{1}\parallel BA$,  and $B_{1}$ and $Q$ lie on opposite sides of line $AC$.  Prove that the points $B_{1}$,  $C_{1}$,  $P$,  and $Q$ lie on a circle.
