By a pure repeating decimal (in base $10$), we mean a decimal $0.\overline{a_1\cdots a_k}$ which repeats in blocks of $k$ digits beginning at the decimal point.  An example is $.243243243\cdots = \tfrac{9}{37}$.  By a mixed repeating decimal we mean a decimal $0.b_1\cdots b_m\overline{a_1\cdots a_k}$ which eventually repeats, but which cannot be reduced to a pure repeating decimal.  An example is $.011363636\cdots = \tfrac{1}{88}$.

Prove that if a mixed repeating decimal is written as a fraction $\tfrac pq$ in lowest terms, then the denominator $q$ is divisible by $2$ or $5$ or both.
