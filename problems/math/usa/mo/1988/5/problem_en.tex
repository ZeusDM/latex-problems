A polynomial product of the form \[(1-z)^{b_1}(1-z^2)^{b_2}(1-z^3)^{b_3}(1-z^4)^{b_4}(1-z^5)^{b_5}\cdots(1-z^{32})^{b_{32}},\]where the $b_k$ are positive integers, has the surprising property that if we multiply it out and discard all terms involving $z$ to a power larger than $32$,  what is left is just $1-2z$.  Determine, with proof, $b_{32}$.
