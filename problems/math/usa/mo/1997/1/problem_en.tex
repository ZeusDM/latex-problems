Let $p_1, p_2, p_3, \ldots$ be the prime numbers listed in increasing order, and let $x_0$ be a real number between 0 and 1.  For positive integer $k$,  define\[ x_k = \begin{cases} 0 & \mbox{if} \; x_{k-1} = 0, \\[.1in] {\displaystyle \left\{ \frac{p_k}{x_{k-1}} \right\}} & \mbox{if} \; x_{k-1} \neq 0, \end{cases}  \]

where $\{x\}$ denotes the fractional part of $x$.  (The fractional part of $x$ is given by $x - \lfloor x \rfloor$ where $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.) Find, with proof, all $x_0$ satisfying $0 < x_0 < 1$ for which the sequence $x_0, x_1, x_2, \ldots$ eventually becomes 0.
