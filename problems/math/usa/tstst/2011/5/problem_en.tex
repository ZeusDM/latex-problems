At a certain orphanage, every pair of orphans are either friends or enemies. For every three of an orphan's friends, an even number of pairs of them are enemies. Prove that it's possible to assign each orphan two parents such that every pair of friends shares exactly one parent, but no pair of enemies does, and no three parents are in a love triangle (where each pair of them has a child).
