Find all real-valued functions $f$ defined on pairs of real numbers, having the following property: for all real numbers $a, b, c$, the median of $f(a,b), f(b,c), f(c,a)$ equals the median of $a, b, c$.

(The \emph{median} of three real numbers, not necessarily distinct, is the number that is in the middle when the three numbers are arranged in nondecreasing order.)
