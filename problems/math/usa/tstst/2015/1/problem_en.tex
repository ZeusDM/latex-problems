Let $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ be a sequence of real numbers, and let $m$ be a fixed positive integer less than $n$. We say an index $k$ with $1\leq k\leq n$ is good if there exists some $\ell$ with $1\leq\ell\leq m$ such that $a_k+a_{k+1}+\ldots+a_{k+\ell-1}\geq0$, where the indices are taken modulo $n$. Let $T$ be the set of all good indices. Prove that $\displaystyle\sum_{k \in T}a_k\geq0$.
