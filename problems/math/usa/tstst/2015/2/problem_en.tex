Let ABC be a scalene triangle. Let $K_a$, $L_a$ and $M_a$ be the respective intersections with BC of the internal angle bisector, external angle bisector, and the median from A. The circumcircle of $AK_aL_a$ intersects $AM_a$ a second time at point $X_a$ different from A. Define $X_b$ and $X_c$ analogously. Prove that the circumcenter of $X_aX_bX_c$ lies on the Euler line of ABC.

(The Euler line of ABC is the line passing through the circumcenter, centroid, and orthocenter of ABC.)
