Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incenter $I$, and whose incircle is tangent to $\overline{BC}$, $\overline{CA}$, $\overline{AB}$ at $D$, $E$, $F$, respectively.  Let $K$ be the foot of the altitude from $D$ to $\overline{EF}$.  Suppose that the circumcircle of $\triangle AIB$ meets the incircle at two distinct points $C_1$ and $C_2$, while the circumcircle of $\triangle AIC$ meets the incircle at two distinct points $B_1$ and $B_2$.  Prove that the radical axis of the circumcircles of $\triangle BB_1B_2$ and $\triangle CC_1C_2$ passes through the midpoint $M$ of $\overline{DK}$.
