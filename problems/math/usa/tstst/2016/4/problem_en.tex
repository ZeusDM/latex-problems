Suppose that $n$ and $k$ are positive integers such that \[ 1 = \underbrace{\varphi( \varphi( \dots \varphi(}_{k\ \text{times}} n) \dots )). \] Prove that $n \le 3^k$.

Here $\varphi(n)$ denotes Euler's totient function, i.e. $\varphi(n)$ denotes the number of elements of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ which are relatively prime to $n$. In particular, $\varphi(1) = 1$.
