Suppose $P$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients such that for every positive integer $n$, the sum of the decimal digits of $|P(n)|$ is not a Fibonacci number. Must $P$ be constant?

(A \emph{Fibonacci number} is an element of the sequence $F_0, F_1, \dots$ defined recursively by $F_0=0, F_1=1,$ and $F_{k+2} = F_{k+1}+F_k$ for $k\ge 0$.)
