Consider coins with positive real denominations not exceeding 1. Find the smallest $C>0$ such that the following holds: if we are any $100$ such coins with total value $50$, then we can always split them into two stacks of $50$ coins each such that the absolute difference between the total values of the two stacks is at most $C$.
