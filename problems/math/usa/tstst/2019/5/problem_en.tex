Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with orthocenter $H$ and circumcircle $\Gamma$. A line through $H$ intersects segments $AB$ and $AC$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively. Let $K$ be the circumcenter of $\triangle AEF$, and suppose line $AK$ intersects $\Gamma$ again at a point $D$. Prove that line $HK$ and the line through $D$ perpendicular to $\overline{BC}$ meet on $\Gamma$.
