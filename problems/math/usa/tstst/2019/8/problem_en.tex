Let $\mathcal S$ be a set of $16$ points in the plane, no three collinear. Let $\chi(S)$ denote the number of ways to draw $8$ lines with endpoints in $\mathcal S$, such that no two drawn segments intersect, even at endpoints. Find the smallest possible value of $\chi(\mathcal S)$ across all such $\mathcal S$.
