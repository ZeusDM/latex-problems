Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with circumcircle $\omega$, and let $H$ be the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $\overline{BC}$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be the points on $\omega$ with $PA=PH$ and $QA=QH$. The tangent to $\omega$ and $P$ intersects lines $AC$ and $AB$ at $E_1$ and $F_1$ respectively; the tangent to $\omega$ at $Q$ intersects lines $AC$ and $AB$ at $E_2$ and $F_2$ respectively. Show that the circumcircles of $\triangle{AE_1F_1}$ and $\triangle{AE_2F_2}$ are congruent, and the line through their centers is parallel to the tangent to $\omega$ at $A$.
