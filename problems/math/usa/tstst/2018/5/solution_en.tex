Let $M,N$ be the midpoints of $AB,AC$, and let $O$ be the circumcenter of $AB,AC$. Observe that $MOQF_2$ is cyclic because $\angle{F_2MO}=\angle{F_2QO}=\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $AMON$ is clearly cyclic. Then \[\measuredangle{OF_2E_2}=\measuredangle{OF_2Q}=\measuredangle{OMQ}=\measuredangle{OMN}=\measuredangle{OAN}=\measuredangle{OAE_2},\] so $OAF_2E_2$ cyclic. Similarly, $OAE_1F_1$ cyclic. So the radical axis of $\left(AE_1F_1\right)$ and $\left(AE_2F_2\right)$ is $AO$, so the line through their centers is parallel to the tangent to $\omega$ at $A$.

Now, observe that $O$ is the center of spiral similarity sending $E_1F_1$ to $E_2F_2$, and $OP=OQ$ are the altitudes from $O$ to each of these segments, so this is actually just a rotation. Then $E_1F_1=E_2F_2$, so since $\angle{E_1AF_1}=\angle{E_2AF_2}$, the circles $\left(AE_1F_1\right)$ and $\left(AE_2F_2\right)$ are congruent.
