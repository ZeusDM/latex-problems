Show that there is an absolute constant $c<1$ with the following property: whenever $\mathcal{P}$ is a polygon with area $1$ in the plane, one can translate it by a distance of $\frac{1}{100}$ in some direction to obtain a polygon $\mathcal{Q}$, for which the intersection of the interiors of $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$  has total area at most $c$.
