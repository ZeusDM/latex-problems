For an integer $n>0$, denote by $\mathcal{F}\left(n\right)$ the set of integers $m>0$ for which the polynomial $p\left(x\right)=x^2+mx+n$ has an integer root.

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Let $S$ denote the set of integers $n>0$ for which $\mathcal{F}\left(n\right)$ contains two consecutive integers. Show that $S$ is infinite but \[\displaystyle\sum_{n\in S}\frac{1}{n}\leq1.\]
	\item Prove that there are infinitely positive integers $n$ such that $\mathcal{F}\left(n\right)$ contains three consecutive integers.
\end{enumerate}
