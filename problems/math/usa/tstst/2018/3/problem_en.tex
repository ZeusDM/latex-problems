Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with incenter $I$, circumcenter $O$, and circumcircle $\Gamma$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$. Ray $AI$ meets $\overline{BC}$ at $D$. Denote by $\omega$ and $\gamma$ the circumcircles of $\triangle{BIC}$ and $\triangle{BAD}$, respectively. Line $MO$ meets $\omega$ at $X$ and $Y$, while line $CO$ meets $\omega$ at $C$ and $Q$. Assume that $Q$ lies inside $\triangle{ABC}$ and $\angle{AQM}=\angle{ACB}$.

Consider the tangents to $\omega$ at $X$ and $Y$ and the tangents to $\gamma$ at $A$ and $D$. Given that $\angle{BAC}\neq60^\circ$, prove that these four lines are concurrent on $\Gamma$.
