Let $S=\left\{1,\ldots,100\right\}$, and for every positive integer $n$ define \[T_n=\left\{\left(a_1,\ldots,a_n\right)\in S^n\mid a_1+\ldots+a_n\equiv0\pmod{100}\right\}.\] Determine which $n$ have the following property: if we color any $75$ elements of $S$ red, then at least half of the $n$-tuples in $T_n$ have an even number of coordinates with red elements.
