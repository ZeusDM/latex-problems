Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $D$, $E$, $F$ be the midpoints of arcs $BC$, $CA$, $AB$ on the circumcircle.  Line $\ell_a$ passes through the feet of the perpendiculars from $A$ to $DB$ and $DC$.  Line $m_a$ passes through the feet of the perpendiculars from $D$ to $AB$ and $AC$.  Let $A_1$ denote the intersection of lines $\ell_a$ and $m_a$.  Define points $B_1$ and $C_1$ similarly.  Prove that triangle $DEF$ and $A_1B_1C_1$ are similar to each other.
