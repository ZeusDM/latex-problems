Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$, circumcenter $O$, and orthocenter $H$. Assume that $AB\neq AC$ and that $\angle A \neq 90^{\circ}$. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of sides $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, and let $E$ and $F$ be the feet of the altitudes from $B$ and $C$ in $\triangle ABC$, respectively. Let $P$ be the intersection of line $MN$ with the tangent line to $\Gamma$ at $A$. Let $Q$ be the intersection point, other than $A$, of $\Gamma$ with the circumcircle of $\triangle AEF$. Let $R$ be the intersection of lines $AQ$ and $EF$. Prove that $PR\perp OH$.
