Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incenter $I$. Let $D$ be a point on side $BC$ and let $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ be the incircles of $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle ACD$, respectively. Suppose that $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ are tangent to segment $BC$ at points $E$ and $F$, respectively. Let $P$ be the intersection of segment $AD$ with the line joining the centers of $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$. Let $X$ be the intersection point of lines $BI$ and $CP$ and let $Y$ be the intersection point of lines $CI$ and $BP$. Prove that lines $EX$ and $FY$ meet on the incircle of $\triangle ABC$.
