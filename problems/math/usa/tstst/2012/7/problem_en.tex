Triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in circle $\Omega$. The interior angle bisector of angle $A$ intersects side $BC$ and $\Omega$ at $D$ and $L$ (other than $A$), respectively. Let $M$ be the midpoint of side $BC$. The circumcircle of triangle $ADM$ intersects sides $AB$ and $AC$ again at $Q$ and $P$ (other than $A$), respectively. Let $N$ be the midpoint of segment $PQ$, and let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $L$ to line $ND$. Prove that line $ML$ is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle $HMN$.
