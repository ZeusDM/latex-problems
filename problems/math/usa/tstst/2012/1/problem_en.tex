Determine all infinite strings of letters with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Each letter is either $T$ or $S$,
	\item If position $i$ and $j$ both have the letter $T$, then position $i+j$ has the letter $S$,
	\item There are infinitely many integers $k$ such that position $2k-1$ has the $k$th $T$.
\end{enumerate}
