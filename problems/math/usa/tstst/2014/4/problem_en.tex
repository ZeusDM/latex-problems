Let $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ be arbitrary polynomials with real coefficients, and let $d$ be the degree of $P(x)$. Assume that $P(x)$ is not the zero polynomial. Prove that there exist polynomials $A(x)$ and $B(x)$ with real coefficients, such that:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item both $A$ and $B$ have degree at most $d/2$, and
	\item at most one of $A$ and $B$ is the zero polynomial, and
	\item $\frac{A(x)+Q(x)B(x)}{P(x)}$ is a polynomial with real coefficients. That is, there is some polynomial $C(x)$ with real coefficients such that $A(x)+Q(x)B(x)=P(x)C(x)$.
\end{enumerate}
