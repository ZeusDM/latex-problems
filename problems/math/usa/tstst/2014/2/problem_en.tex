Consider a convex pentagon circumscribed about a circle. We name the lines that connect vertices of the pentagon with the opposite points of tangency with the circle \emph{gergonnians}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Prove that if four gergonnians are conncurrent, the all five of them are concurrent.
	\item Prove that if there is a triple of gergonnians that are concurrent, then there is another triple of gergonnians that are concurrent.
\end{enumerate}
