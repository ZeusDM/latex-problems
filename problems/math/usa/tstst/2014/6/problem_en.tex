Suppose we have distinct positive integers $a, b, c, d$, and an odd prime $p$ not dividing any of them, and an integer $M$ such that if one considers the infinite sequence
\begin{align*}
	ca &- db \\
	ca^2 &- db^2 \\
	ca^3 &- db^3 \\
	ca^4 &- db^4 \\
	&\vdots
\end{align*}
and looks at the highest power of $p$ that divides each of them, these powers are not all zero, and are all at most $M$. Prove that there exists some $T$ (which may depend on $a,b,c,d,p,M$) such that whenever $p$ divides an element of this sequence, the maximum power of $p$ that divides that element is exactly $p^T$.
