Let $\leftarrow$ denote the left arrow key on a standard keyboard. If one opens a text editor and types the keys ``$\text{ab}\leftarrow\text{cd}\leftarrow\leftarrow\text{e}\leftarrow\leftarrow\text{f}'', the result is ``faecdb''. We say that a string $B$ is \emph{reachable} from a string $A$ if it is possible to insert some amount of $\leftarrow$'s into $A$, such that typing the resulting characters produces $B$. So, our example shows that ``faecdb'' is reachable from ``abcdef''.

Prove that for any two strings $A$ and $B$, $A$ is reachable from $B$ if and only if $B$ is reachable from $A$.
