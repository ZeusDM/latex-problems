In the nation of Onewaynia, certain pairs of cities are connected by roads. Every road connects exactly two cities (roads are allowed to cross each other, e.g., via bridges). Some roads have a traffic capacity of $1$ unit and other roads have a traffic capacity of $2$ units. However, on every road, traffic is only allowed to travel in one direction. It is known that for every city, the sum of the capacities of the roads connected to it is always odd. The transportation minister needs to assign a direction to every road. Prove that he can do it in such a way that for every city, the difference between the sum of the capacities of roads entering the city and the sum of the capacities of roads leaving the city is always exactly one.
