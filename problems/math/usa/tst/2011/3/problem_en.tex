Let $p$ be a prime. We say that a sequence of integers $\{z_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ is a \emph{$p$-pod} if for each $e \geq 0$, there is an $N \geq 0$ such that whenever $m \geq N$, $p^e$ divides the sum \[\sum_{k=0}^m (-1)^k {m \choose k} z_k.\] Prove that if both sequences $\{x_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ and $\{y_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ are $p$-pods, then the sequence $\{x_ny_n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ is a $p$-pod.
