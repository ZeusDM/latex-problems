Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral and let $E$ and $F$ be the feet of perpendiculars from the intersection of diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ to $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$, respectively. Prove that $\overline{EF}$ is perpendicular to the line through the midpoints of $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$.
