Let $p$ be a prime number. For integers $r,s$ such that $rs\left(r^2-s^2\right)$ is not divisible by $p$, let $f\left(r,s\right)$ denote the number of integers $n\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,p-1\right\}$ such that $\left\{rn/p\right\}$ and $\left\{sn/p\right\}$ are either both less than $1/2$ or both greater than $1/2$. Prove that there exists $N>0$ such that for $p\geq N$ and all $r,s$, \[\left\lceil\frac{p-1}{3}\right\rceil\leq f\left(r,s\right)\leq\left\lfloor\frac{2\left(p-1\right)}{3}\right\rfloor.\]
