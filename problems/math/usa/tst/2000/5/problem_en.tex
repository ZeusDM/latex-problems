Let $n$ be a positive integer. A \emph{corner} is a finite set $S$ of ordered $n$-tuples of positive integers such that if $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n,b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$ are positive integers with $a_k\geq b_k$ for $k=1,2,\ldots,n$ and $\left(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\right)\in S$, then $\left(b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n\right)\in S$. Prove that among any infinite collection of corners, there exist two corners, one of which is a subset of the other one.
