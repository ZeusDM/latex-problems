Let $ABC$ be a triangle. Choose a point $D$ in its interior. Let $\omega_1$ be a circle passing through $B$ and $D$ and $\omega_2$ be a circle passing through $C$ and $D$ so that the other point of intersection of the two circles lies on $AD$. Let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect side $BC$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively. Denote by $X$ the intersection of $DF$, $AB$ and $Y$ the intersection of $DE, AC$. Show that $XY \parallel BC$.
