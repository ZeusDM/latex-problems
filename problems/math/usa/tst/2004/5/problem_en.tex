Let $A = (0, 0, 0)$ in 3D space. Define the \emph{weight} of a point as the sum of the absolute values of the coordinates. Call a point a \emph{primitive lattice point} if all of its coordinates are integers who are relatively prime. Let square $ABCD$ be an \emph{unbalanced primitive integer square} if it has integer side length and also, $B$ and $D$ are primitive lattice points with different weights. Prove that there are infinitely many unbalanced primitive integer squares such that the planes containing the squares are not parallel to each other.
