Let $ABC$ be a non-equilateral triangle and let $M_a$, $M_b$, $M_c$ be the midpoints of the sides $BC$, $CA$, $AB$, respectively. Let $S$ be a point lying on the Euler line. Denote by $X$, $Y$, $Z$ the second intersections of $M_aS$, $M_bS$, $M_cS$ with the nine-point circle. Prove that $AX$, $BY$, $CZ$ are concurrent.
