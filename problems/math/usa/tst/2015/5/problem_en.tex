A tournament is a directed graph for which every (unordered) pair of vertices has a single directed edge from one vertex to the other. Let us define a proper directed-edge-coloring to be an assignment of a color to every (directed) edge, so that for every pair of directed edges $\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\overrightarrow{vw}$, those two edges are in different colors. Note that it is permissible for $\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\overrightarrow{uw}$ to be the same color. The directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament is defined to be the minimum total number of colors that can be used in order to create a proper directed-edge-coloring. For each $n$, determine the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number over all tournaments on $n$ vertices.
