Let $ N > M > 1$ be fixed integers. There are $ N$ people playing in a chess tournament; each pair of players plays each other once, with no draws. It turns out that for each sequence of $ M + 1$ distinct players $ P_0, P_1, \ldots P_M$ such that $ P_{i - 1}$ beat $ P_i$ for each $ i = 1, \ldots, M$, player $ P_0$ also beat $ P_M$. Prove that the players can be numbered $ 1,2, \ldots, N$ in such a way that, whenever $ a \geq b + M - 1$, player $ a$ beat player $ b$.
