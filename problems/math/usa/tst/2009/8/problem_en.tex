Fix a prime number $p>5$. Let $a,b,c$ be integers no two of which have their difference divisible by $p$. Let $i,j,k$ be nonnegative integers such that $i+j+k$ is divisible by $p-1$. Suppose that for all integers $x$, the quantity \[\left(x-a\right)\left(x-b\right)\left(x-c\right)\left[\left(x-a\right)^i\left(x-b\right)^j\left(x-c\right)^k-1\right]\] is divisible by $p$. Prove that each of $i,j,k$ must be divisible by $p-1$.
