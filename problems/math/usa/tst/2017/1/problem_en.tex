In a sports league, each team uses a set of at most $t$ signature colors. A set $S$ of teams is \emph{color-identifiable} if one can assign each team in $S$ one of their signature colors, such that no team in $S$ is assigned any signature color of a different team in $S$.

For all positive integers $n$ and $t$, determine the maximum integer $g\left(n,t\right)$ such that: In any sports league with exactly $n$ distinct colors present over all teams, one can always find a color-identifiable set of size at least $g\left(n,t\right)$.
