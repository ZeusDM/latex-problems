You are cheating at a trivia contest. For each question, you can peek at each of the $n > 1$ other contestants' guesses before writing down your own. For each question, after all guesses are submitted, the emcee announces the correct answer. A correct guess is worth $0$ points. An incorrect guess is worth $-2$ points for other contestants, but only $-1$ point for you, since you hacked the scoring system. After announcing the correct answer, the emcee proceeds to read the next question. Show that if you are leading by $2^{n - 1}$ points at any time, then you can surely win first place.
