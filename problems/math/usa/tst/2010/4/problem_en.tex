Let $ABC$ be a triangle. Point $M$ and $N$ lie on sides $AC$ and $BC$ respectively such that $MN || AB$. Points $P$ and $Q$ lie on sides $AB$ and $CB$ respectively such that $PQ\parallel AC$. The incircle of triangle $CMN$ touches segment $AC$ at $E$. The incircle of triangle $BPQ$ touches segment $AB$ at $F$. Line $EN$ and $AB$ meet at $R$, and lines $FQ$ and $AC$ meet at $S$. Given that $AE = AF$, prove that the incenter of triangle $AEF$ lies on the incircle of triangle $ARS$.
