Let $ABC$ be an acute scalene triangle and let $P$ be a point in its interior. Let $A_1$, $B_1$, $C_1$ be projections of $P$ onto triangle sides $BC$, $CA$, $AB$, respectively. Find the locus of points $P$ such that $AA_1$, $BB_1$, $CC_1$ are concurrent and $\angle PAB + \angle PBC + \angle PCA = 90^{\circ}$.
