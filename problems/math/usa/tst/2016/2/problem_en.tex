Let $ABC$ be a scalene triangle with circumcircle $\Omega$, and suppose the incircle of $ABC$ touches $BC$ at $D$. The angle bisector of $\angle A$ meets $BC$ and $\Omega$ at $E$ and $F$.  The circumcircle of $\triangle DEF$ intersects the $A$-excircle at $S_1$, $S_2$, and $\Omega$ at $T \neq F$. Prove that line $AT$ passes through either $S_1$ or $S_2$.
