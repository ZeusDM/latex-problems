Two circles $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ have common external tangents $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ meeting at $T$. Suppose $\ell_1$ touches $\Gamma_1$ at $A$ and $\ell_2$ touches $\Gamma_2$ at $B$. A circle $\Omega$ through $A$ and $B$ intersects $\Gamma_1$ again at $C$ and $\Gamma_2$ again at $D$,  such that quadrilateral $ABCD$ is convex.

Suppose lines $AC$ and $BD$ meet at point $X$,  while lines $AD$ and $BC$ meet at point $Y$. Show that $T$,  $X$,  $Y$ are collinear.
