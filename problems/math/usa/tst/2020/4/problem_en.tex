For a finite simple graph $G$,  we define $G'$ to be the graph on the same vertex set as $G$,  where for any two vertices $u \neq v$,  the pair $\{u,v\}$ is an edge of $G'$ if and only if $u$ and $v$ have a common neighbor in $G$.

Prove that if $G$ is a finite simple graph which is isomorphic to $(G')'$,  then $G$ is also isomorphic to $G'$.
