Find all integers $n \ge 2$ for which there exists an integer $m$ and a polynomial $P(x)$ with integer coefficients satisfying the following three conditions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $m > 1$ and $\gcd(m,n) = 1$;
	\item the numbers $P(0)$,  $P^2(0)$,  $\ldots$,  $P^{m-1}(0)$ 		are not divisible by $n$; and
	\item $P^m(0)$ is divisible by $n$.
\end{itemize}

Here $P^k$ means $P$ applied $k$ times, so $P^1(0) = P(0)$,  $P^2(0) = P(P(0))$,  etc.
