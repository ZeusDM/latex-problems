Let $n$ be an integer greater than 2, and $P_1, P_2, \cdots , P_n$ distinct points in the plane. Let $\mathcal S$ denote the union of all segments $P_1P_2, P_2P_3, \dots , P_{n-1}P_{n}$. Determine if it is always possible to find points $A$ and $B$ in $\mathcal S$ such that $P_1P_n \parallel AB$ (segment $AB$ can lie on line $P_1P_n$) and $P_1P_n = kAB$, where (1) $k = 2.5$; (2) $k = 3$.
