Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $S$ be a set of $2^n+1$ elements. Let $f$ be a function from the set of two-element subsets of $S$ to $\{0, \dots, 2^{n-1}-1\}$. Assume that for any elements $x, y, z$ of $S$, one of $f(\{x,y\}), f(\{y,z\}), f(\{z, x\})$ is equal to the sum of the other two. Show that there exist $a, b, c$ in $S$ such that $f(\{a,b\}), f(\{b,c\}), f(\{c,a\})$ are all equal to 0.
