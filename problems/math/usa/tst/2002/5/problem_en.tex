Consider the family of  nonisosceles triangles $ABC$ satisfying the property $AC^2 + BC^2 = 2 AB^2$. Points $M$ and $D$ lie on side $AB$ such that $AM = BM$ and $\angle ACD = \angle BCD$. Point $E$ is in the plane such that $D$ is the incenter of triangle $CEM$. Prove that exactly one of the ratios \[ \frac{CE}{EM}, \quad \frac{EM}{MC}, \quad \frac{MC}{CE}  \] is constant.
