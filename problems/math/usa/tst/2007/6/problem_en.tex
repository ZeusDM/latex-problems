For a polynomial $ P(x)$ with integer coefficients, $ r(2i - 1)$ (for $ i = 1,2,3,\ldots,512$) is the remainder obtained when $ P(2i - 1)$ is divided by $ 1024$. The sequence \[ (r(1),r(3),\ldots,r(1023))\] is called the \emph{remainder sequence} of $ P(x)$. A remainder sequence is called \emph{complete} if it is a permutation of $ (1,3,5,\ldots,1023)$. Prove that there are no more than $ 2^{35}$ different complete remainder sequences.
