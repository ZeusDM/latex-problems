Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $S \subseteq \{0, 1\}^n$ be a set of binary strings of length $n$. Given an odd number $x_1, \dots, x_{2k + 1} \in S$ of binary strings (not necessarily distinct), their \emph{majority} is defined as the binary string $y \in \{0, 1\}^n$ for which the $i^{\text{th}}$ bit of $y$ is the most common bit among the $i^{\text{th}}$ bits of $x_1, \dots,x_{2k + 1}$. (For example, if $n = 4$ the majority of $0000, 0000, 1101, 1100, 0101$ is $0100$.)

Suppose that for some positive integer $k$, $S$ has the property $P_k$ that the majority of any $2k + 1$ binary strings in $S$ (possibly with repetition) is also in $S$. Prove that $S$ has the same property $P_k$ for all positive integers $k$.
