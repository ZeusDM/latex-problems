Let $ABCD$ be a convex cyclic quadrilateral which is not a kite, but whose diagonals are perpendicular and meet at $H$. Denote by $M$ and $N$ the midpoints of $\overline{BC}$ and $\overline{CD}$. Rays $MH$ and $NH$ meet $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{AB}$ at $S$ and $T$, respectively. Prove that there exists a point $E$, lying outside quadrilateral $ABCD$, such that
\begin{itemize}
	\item ray $EH$ bisects both angles $\angle BES$, $\angle TED$, and
	\item $\angle BEN = \angle MED$.
\end{itemize}
