Alice and Bob play a game. First, Alice secretly picks a finite set $S$ of lattice points in the Cartesian plane. Then, for every line $\ell$ in the plane which is horizontal, vertical, or has slope $+1$ or $-1$, she tells Bob the number of points of $S$ that lie on $\ell$. Bob wins if he can determine the set $S$.

Prove that if Alice picks $S$ to be of the form \[S = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 \mid m \le x^2 + y^2 \le n\}\] for some positive integers $m$ and $n$, then Bob can win. (Bob does not know in advance that $S$ is of this form.)
