At a university dinner, there are 2017 mathematicians who each order two distinct entr\'ees, with no two mathematicians ordering the same pair of entr\'ees. The cost of each entr\'ee is equal to the number of mathematicians who ordered it, and the university pays for each mathematician's less expensive entr\'ee (ties broken arbitrarily). Over all possible sets of orders, what is the maximum total amount the university could have paid?
