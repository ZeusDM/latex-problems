In acute triangle $ABC$, $\angle{A}<\angle{B}$ and $\angle{A}<\angle{C}$. Let $P$ be a variable point on side $BC$. Points $D$ and $E$ lie on sides $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, such that $BP=PD$ and $CP=PE$. Prove that as $P$ moves along side $BC$, the circumcircle of triangle $ADE$ passes through a fixed point other than $A$.
