Consider (3-variable) polynomials \[P_n(x,y,z)=(x-y)^{2n}(y-z)^{2n}+(y-z)^{2n}(z-x)^{2n}+(z-x)^{2n}(x-y)^{2n}\] and \[Q_n(x,y,z)=[(x-y)^{2n}+(y-z)^{2n}+(z-x)^{2n}]^{2n}.\] Determine all positive integers $n$ such that the quotient $Q_n(x,y,z)/P_n(x,y,z)$ is a (3-variable) polynomial with rational coefficients.
