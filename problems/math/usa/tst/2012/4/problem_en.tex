There are $2010$ students and $100$ classrooms in the Olympiad High School. At the beginning, each of the students is in one of the classrooms. Each minute, as long as not everyone is in the same classroom, somebody walks from one classroom into a different classroom with at least as many students in it (prior to his move). This process will terminate in $M$ minutes. Determine the maximum value of $M$.
