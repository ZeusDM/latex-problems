Let $n$ be an even positive integer, and let $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph with exactly $\tfrac{n^2}{4}$ edges, where there are no loops or multiple edges (each unordered pair of distinct vertices is joined by either $0$ or $1$ edge). An unordered pair of distinct vertices $\{x,y\}$ is said to be \emph{amicable} if they have a common neighbor (there is a vertex $z$ such that $xz$ and $yz$ are both edges). Prove that $G$ has at least $2\textstyle\binom{n/2}{2}$ pairs of vertices which are amicable.
