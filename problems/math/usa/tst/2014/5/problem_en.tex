Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral, and let $E$, $F$, $G$, and $H$ be the midpoints of $AB$, $BC$, $CD$, and $DA$ respectively. Let $W$, $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ be the orthocenters of triangles $AHE$, $BEF$, $CFG$ and $DGH$, respectively. Prove that the quadrilaterals $ABCD$ and $WXYZ$ have the same area.
