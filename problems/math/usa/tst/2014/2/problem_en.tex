Let $a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots$ be a sequence of integers, with the property that every consecutive group of $a_i$'s averages to a perfect square. More precisely, for every positive integers $n$ and $k$, the quantity \[\frac{a_n+a_{n+1}+\ldots+a_{n+k-1}}{k}\] is always the square of an integer. Prove that the sequence must be constant (all $a_i$ are equal to the same perfect square).
