For a prime $p$, a subset $S$ of residues modulo $p$ is called a \emph{sum-free multiplicative subgroup} of $\mathbb F_p$ if:
\begin{itemize}
	\item there is a nonzero residue $\alpha$ modulo $p$ such that $S = \left\{ 1, \alpha^1, \alpha^2, \dots \right\}$ (all considered mod $p$), and
	\item there are no $a,b,c \in S$ (not necessarily distinct) such that $a+b \equiv c \pmod p$.
\end{itemize}
Prove that for every integer $N$, there is a prime $p$ and a sum-free multiplicative subgroup $S$ of $\mathbb F_p$ such that $\left|S\right|\geq N$.
