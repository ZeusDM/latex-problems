Let $ABC$ be a scalene triangle with $\angle BCA = 90^{\circ}$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$.  Let $X$ be a point in the interior of the segment $CD$.  Let $K$ be the point on the segment $AX$ such that $BK = BC$.  Similarly, let $L$ be the point on the segment $BX$ such that $AL = AC$.  The circumcircle of triangle $DKL$ intersects segment $AB$ at a second point $T$ (other than $D$).  Prove that $\angle ACT = \angle BCT$.
