A social club has $2k+1$ members, each of whom is fluent in the same $k$ languages. Any pair of members always talk to each other in only one language. Suppose that there were no three members such that they use only one language among them. Let $A$ be the number of three-member subsets such that the three distinct pairs among them use different languages. Find the maximum possible value of $A$.
