Two incongruent triangles $ABC$ and $XYZ$ are called a pair of \emph{pals} if they satisfy the following conditions: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item the two triangles have the same area;
	\item let $M$ and $W$ be the respective midpoints of sides $BC$ and $YZ$.  The two sets of lengths $\{AB, AM, AC\}$ and $\{XY, XW, XZ\}$ are identical $3$-element sets of pairwise relatively prime integers.
\end{enumerate}
Determine if there are infinitely many pairs of triangles that are pals of each other.
