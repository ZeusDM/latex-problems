There is a set of $ n$ coins with distinct integer weights $ w_1, w_2, \ldots , w_n$. It is known that if any coin with weight $ w_k$, where $ 1 \leq k \leq n$, is removed from the set, the remaining coins can be split into two groups of the same weight. (The number of coins in the two groups can be different.) Find all $ n$ for which such a set of coins exists.
