Let $ ABC$ be a triangle with $ G$ as its centroid. Let $ P$ be a variable point on segment $ BC$. Points $ Q$ and $ R$ lie on sides $ AC$ and $ AB$ respectively, such that $ PQ \parallel AB$ and $ PR \parallel AC$. Prove that, as $ P$ varies along segment $ BC$, the circumcircle of triangle $ AQR$ passes through a fixed point $ X$ such that $ \angle BAG = \angle CAX$.
