Let $ P$, $ Q$, and $ R$ be the points on sides $ BC$, $ CA$, and $ AB$ of an acute triangle $ ABC$ such that triangle $ PQR$ is equilateral and has minimal area among all such equilateral triangles. Prove that the perpendiculars from $ A$ to line $ QR$, from $ B$ to line $ RP$, and from $ C$ to line $ PQ$ are concurrent.
