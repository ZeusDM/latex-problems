We choose random a unitary polynomial of degree $n$ and coefficients in the set $1,2,\ldots,n!$. Prove that the probability for this polynomial to be special is between $0.71$ and $0.75$, where a polynomial $f$ is called special if for every $k>1$ in the sequence $f(1), f(2), f(3),...$ there are infinitely many numbers relatively prime with $k$.
