Let $n$ be an integer greater than $1$. For a positive integer $m$, let $S_{m}= \{ 1,2,\ldots, mn\}$. Suppose that there exists a $2n$-element set $T$ such that
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item each element of $T$ is an $m$-element subset of $S_{m}$;
	\item each pair of elements of $T$ shares at most one common element; and
	\item each element of $S_{m}$ is contained in exactly two elements of $T$.
\end{enumerate}
Determine the maximum possible value of $m$ in terms of $n$.
