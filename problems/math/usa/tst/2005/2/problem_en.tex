Let $A_{1}A_{2}A_{3}$ be an acute triangle, and let $O$ and $H$ be its circumcenter and orthocenter, respectively. For $1\leq i \leq 3$, points $P_{i}$ and $Q_{i}$ lie on lines $OA_{i}$ and $A_{i+1}A_{i+2}$ (where $A_{i+3}=A_{i}$), respectively, such that $OP_{i}HQ_{i}$ is a parallelogram. Prove that \[\frac{OQ_{1}}{OP_{1}}+\frac{OQ_{2}}{OP_{2}}+\frac{OQ_{3}}{OP_{3}}\geq 3.\]
