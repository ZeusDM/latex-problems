Let $ABC$ be a triangle and let $M$ and $N$ denote the midpoints of $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$, respectively. Let $X$ be a point such that $\overline{AX}$ is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. Denote by $\omega_B$ the circle through $M$ and $B$ tangent to $\overline{MX}$, and by $\omega_C$ the circle through $N$ and $C$ tangent to $\overline{NX}$. Show that $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ intersect on line $BC$.
