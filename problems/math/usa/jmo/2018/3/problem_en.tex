Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral inscribed in circle $\omega$ with $\overline{AC} \perp \overline{BD}$. Let $E$ and $F$ be the reflections of $D$ over lines $BA$ and $BC$, respectively, and let $P$ be the intersection of lines $BD$ and $EF$. Suppose that the circumcircle of $\triangle EPD$ meets $\omega$ at $D$ and $Q$, and the circumcircle of $\triangle FPD$ meets $\omega$ at $D$ and $R$. Show that $EQ = FR$.
