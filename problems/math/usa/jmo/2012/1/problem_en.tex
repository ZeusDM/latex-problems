Given a triangle $ABC$, let $P$ and $Q$ be points on segments $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{AC}$, respectively, such that $AP=AQ$. Let $S$ and $R$ be distinct points on segment $\overline{BC}$ such that $S$ lies between $B$ and $R$, $\angle BPS=\angle PRS$, and $\angle CQR=\angle QSR$. Prove that $P,Q,R,S$ are concyclic (in other words, these four points lie on a circle).
