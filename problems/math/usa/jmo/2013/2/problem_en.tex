Each cell of an $m\times n$ board is filled with some nonnegative integer.  Two numbers in the filling are said to be [i]adjacent[/i] if their cells share a common side.  (Note that two numbers in cells that share only a corner are not adjacent).  The filling is called a [i]garden[/i] if it satisfies the following two conditions:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item The difference between any two adjacent numbers is either $0$ or $1$.
	\item If a number is less than or equal to all of its adjacent numbers, then it is equal to $0$.
\end{enumerate}

Determine the number of distinct gardens in terms of $m$ and $n$.
