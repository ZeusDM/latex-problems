Quadrilateral $XABY$ is inscribed in the semicircle $\omega$ with diameter $XY$.  Segments $AY$ and $BX$ meet at $P$.  Point $Z$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to line $XY$.  Point $C$ lies on $\omega$ such that line $XC$ is perpendicular to line $AZ$.  Let $Q$ be the intersection of segments $AY$ and $XC$.  Prove that \[\dfrac{BY}{XP}+\dfrac{CY}{XQ}=\dfrac{AY}{AX}.\]
