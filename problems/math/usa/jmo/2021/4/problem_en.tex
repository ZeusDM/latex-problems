Carina has three pins, labeled $A, B$, and $C$, respectively, located at the origin of the coordinate plane. In a \textit{move}, Carina may move a pin to an adjacent lattice point at distance $1$ away. What is the least number of moves that Carina can make in order for triangle $ABC$ to have area 2021?

(A lattice point is a point $(x, y)$ in the coordinate plane where $x$ and $y$ are both integers, not necessarily positive.)
