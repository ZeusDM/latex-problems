A \emph{word} is defined as any finite string of letters. A word is a \emph{palindrome} if it reads the same backwards and forwards. Let a sequence of words $W_0,W_1,W_2,\ldots$ be defined as follows: $W_0=a,W_1=b$, and for $n\geq2$, $W_n$ is the word formed by writing $W_{n-2}$ followed by $W_{n-1}$. Prove that for any $n\geq1$, the word formed by writing $W_1,W_2,W_3,\ldots,W_n$ in succession is a palindrome.
