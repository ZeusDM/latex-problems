We will use projective geometry. For distinct points $Q_1,Q_2,Q_3,Q_4$, let \[\left(Q_1,Q_2;Q_3,Q_4\right)=\frac{Q_3Q_1}{Q_3Q_2}\div\frac{Q_4Q_1}{Q_4Q_2}\] where lengths are directed.

Let chords $BD$ and $BE$ intersect line $PC$ at $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Since $BD$ is the polar of $P$ with respect to $\omega$, we have that \[\left(P,X;A,C\right)=-1.\] Projecting through $B$ onto $\omega$ gives that \[-1=\left(P,X;A,C\right)\stackrel{B}{=}\left(B,D;A,C\right)_{\omega}.\] Projecting through $E$ onto line $PC$ gives that \[-1=\left(B,D;A,C\right)_{\omega}\stackrel{E}{=}\left(Y,\infty_{AC};A,C\right)\] where $\infty_{AC}$ is the point at infinity with respect to line $AC$. But this implies that $Y$ is the midpoint of $AC$, so $BE$ bisects $AC$ as desired.
