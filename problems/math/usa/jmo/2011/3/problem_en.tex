For a point $P=\left(a,a^2\right)$ in the coordinate plane, let $l\left(P\right)$ denote the line passing through $P$ with slope $2a$. Consider the set of triangles with vertices of the form $P_1=\left(a_1,a_1^2\right),P_2=\left(a_2,a_2^2\right),P_3=\left(a_3,a_3^2\right)$, such that the intersection of the lines $l\left(P_1\right),l\left(P_2\right),l\left(P_3\right)$ form an equilateral triangle $\triangle$. Find the locus of the center of $\triangle$ as $P_1P_2P_3$ ranges over all such triangles.
