Suppose $a,b$ are both odd. Let $A$ and $P$ be the number of apples and pears in odd-numbered bowls. Note that $A-P$ is constant (every time we change the parity of an apple, we also change the parity of a pear). But initially $A=\frac{a+1}{2}$ and $P=\frac{b-1}{2}$, and at the end $A=\frac{a-1}{2}$ and $P=\frac{b+1}{2}$, contradiction. Thus $ab$ is even.

Now suppose $ab$ is even; WLOG let $a$ be even (otherwise flip the row symmetrically).
