Since $\triangle{AEF}\sim\triangle{ABC}$ with ratio $\cos A$, we get that the ratio of $A$-exradii is also $\cos A$. But if $EF$ is tangent to the $A$-excircle of $\triangle{ABC}$, then the $A$-excircles of $\triangle{ABC}$ and $\triangle{AEF}$ are the same, and thus this ratio is $1$. So $\cos A=1$, contradiction.
