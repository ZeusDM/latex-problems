Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle{ABC}$ obtuse. The \emph{$A$-excircle} is a circle in the exterior of $\triangle{ABC}$ that is tangent to side $BC$ of the triangle and tangent to the extensions of the other two sides. Let $E,F$ be the feet of the altitudes from $B$ and $C$ to lines $AC$ and $AB$, respectively. Can line $EF$ be tangent to the $A$-excircle?
