Two permutations $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2010}$ and $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_{2010}$ of the numbers $1,2,\ldots,2010$ are said to \emph{intersect} if $a_k=b_k$ for some value of $k$ in the range $1\leq k\leq2010$. Show that there exist $1006$ permutations of the numbers $1,2,\ldots,2010$ such that any other such permutation is guaranteed to intersect at least one of these $1006$ permutations.
