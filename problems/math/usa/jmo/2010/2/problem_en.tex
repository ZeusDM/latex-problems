Let $n>1$ be an integer. Find, with proof, all sequences $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{n-1}$ of positive integers with the following three properties:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item $x_1<x_2<\cdots<x_{n-1}$
	\item $x_i+x_{n-i}=2n$ for all $i=1,2,\ldots,n-1$
	\item given any two indices $i$ and $j$ (not necessarily distinct) for which $x_i+x_j<2n$, there is an index $k$ such that $x_i+x_j=x_k$.
\end{enumerate}
