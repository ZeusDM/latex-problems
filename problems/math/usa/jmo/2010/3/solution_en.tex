Let $T=PQ\cap RS$. Note that $PQ$ and $RS$ are the Simson lines of $Y$ with respect to $\triangle{AXB}$ and $\triangle{AZB}$, respectively. Thus, $T$ is the projection of $Y$ onto $AB$. Let $\ell_X$, $\ell_Z$ be the Steiner line of $Y$ with respect to $\triangle{AXB}$ and $\triangle{AZB}$, respectively. Then $X\in\ell_X$, $Z\in\ell_Z$ and $\ell_X\parallel PQ$, $\ell_Z\parallel RS$ by the fact that the orthocenter lies on the Steiner line and using Simson lines.

Let $\omega$ be the circle with diameter $AB$.I claim that $\ell_X\cap\ell_Z\in\omega$. Let $Y'$ be the reflection of $Y$ over $T$. It is clear that $Y'\in\omega$ as $Y\in\omega$. But note that it is on both Steiner lines by definition, so $Y'\in\ell_X,\ell_Z$. This implies that $\ell_X\cap\ell_Z\in\omega$.

Now, \[\angle{PTZ}=\angle{XY'Z}=\frac{1}{2}\angle{XOZ}\] by parallel lines and circle angles.
