Let $AXYZB$ be a convex pentagon inscribed in a semicircle of diameter $AB$. Denote by
$P,Q,R,S$ the feet of the perpendiculars from $Y$ onto lines $AX,BX,AZ,BZ$, respectively. Prove that the acute angle formed by lines $PQ$ and $RS$ is half the size of $\angle{XOZ}$, where $O$ is the midpoint of segment $AB$.
