The sequence of words $\left\{a_n\right\}$ is defined as follows: $a_1=X$, $a_2=O$, and for $n\geq3$, $a_n$ is $a_{n-1}$ followed by the reverse of $a_{n-2}$. For example, $a_3=OX$, $a_4=OXO$, $a_5=OXOXO$, and $a_6=OXOXOOXO$. Compute the number of palindromes in the first $1000$ terms of this sequence.
