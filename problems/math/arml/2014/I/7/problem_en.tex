Let $N$ be the least integer greater than $20$ that is a palindrome in both base $20$ and base $14$. For example, the three-digit base-$14$ numeral $\left(13\right)5\left(13\right)_{14}$ (representing $13\cdot14^2+5\cdot14^1+13\cdot14^0$) is a palindrome in base $14$, but not in base $20$, and the three-digit base-$14$ numeral $\left(13\right)31_{14}$ is not a palindrome in base $14$. Compute the base-$10$ representation of $N$.
