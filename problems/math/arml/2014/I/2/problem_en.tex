Let $A$, $B$, and $C$ be randomly chosen (not necessarily distinct) integers between $0$ and $4$ inclusive. Pat and Chris compute the value of $A+B\cdot C$ by two different methods. Pat follows the proper order of operations, computing $A+\left(B\cdot C\right)$. Chris ignores order of operations, choosing instead to compute $\left(A+B\right)\cdot C$. Compute the probability that Pat and Chris get the same answer.
