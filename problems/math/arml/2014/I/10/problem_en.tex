An integer-valued function $f$ is called \emph{tenuous} if $f\left(x\right)+f\left(y\right)>x^2$ for all positive integers $x$ and $y$. Let $g$ be a tenuous function such that $g\left(1\right)+g\left(2\right)+\cdots+g\left(20\right)$ is as small as possible. Compute the minimum possible value for $g\left(14\right)$.
