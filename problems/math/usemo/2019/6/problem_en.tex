Let $ABC$ be an acute scalene triangle with circumcenter $O$ and altitudes $\overline{AD}$, $\overline{BE}$, $\overline{CF}$. Let $X$, $Y$, $Z$ be the midpoints of $\overline{AD}$, $\overline{BE}$, $\overline{CF}$. Lines $AD$ and $YZ$ intersect at $P$, lines $BE$ and $ZX$ intersect at $Q$, and lines $CF$ and $XY$ intersect at $R$.

Suppose that lines $YZ$ and $BC$ intersect at $A'$, and lines $QR$ and $EF$ intersect at $D'$. Prove that the perpendiculars from $A$, $B$, $C$, $O$, to the lines $QR$, $RP$, $PQ$, $A'D'$, respectively, are concurrent.
