Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral. A circle centered at $O$ passes through $B$ and $D$ and meets lines $BA$ and $BC$ again at points $E$ and $F$ (distinct from $A,B,C$). Let $H$ denote the orthocenter of triangle $DEF.$ Prove that if lines $AC,$ $DO,$ $EF$ are concurrent, then triangle $ABC$ and $EHF$ are similar.
