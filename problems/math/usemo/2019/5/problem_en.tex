Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a regular polygon, and let $\mathcal{V}$ be its set of vertices. Each point in $\mathcal{V}$ is colored red, white, or blue. A subset of $\mathcal{V}$ is \textit{patriotic} if it contains an equal number of points of each color, and a side of $\mathcal{P}$ is \textit{dazzling} if its endpoints are of different colors.

Suppose that $\mathcal{V}$ is patriotic and the number of dazzling edges of $\mathcal{P}$ is even. Prove that there exists a line, not passing through any point in $\mathcal{V}$, dividing $\mathcal{V}$ into two nonempty patriotic subsets.
