Let $x_0,\dots,x_{2017}$ be a non-decreasing sequence of positive integers. Suppose that $x_0 = 1$ and the set $A=\{x_1,\dots,x_{2017}\}$ consists of exactly $25$ different numbers. Prove that \[\sum_{i=2}^{2017}(x_i-x_{i-2})x_i\geq 623\text{,}\] and find the number of sequences that holds the case of equality.
