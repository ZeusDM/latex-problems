There are finitely many vertical sticks each of length $2017$ fixed on a plate. Each stick has a \emph{bead} that can slide up and down on it. Some of the bead pairs are connected with \emph{elasticated ropes}. \emph{The Young Ant} freely moves on all ropes. \emph{The Old Ant} freely moves on all ropes for which the difference between heights of endpoints is $\pm 1$. It is given that starting at any bead The Young Ant can reach any other bead. A configuration of beads is called an \emph{eligible configuration} when each bead is located on some integer height and the heights of two endpoints of any rope are different. Given that there is at least one eligible configuration of this device, prove that there is an eligible configuration for which The Old Ant starting at any bead can reach any other bead.
