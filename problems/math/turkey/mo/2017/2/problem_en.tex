Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral with non-paralel opposite sides. The lines $AB$ and $CD$ intersect at $X$. 
The intersection points of the circle with center $A$ and radius $r_1$ and the circle with center $D$ and radius $r_2$ are $P$ and $Q$. The intersection points of the circle with center $B$ and radius $r_1$ and the circle with center $C$ and radius $r_2$ are $R$ and $S$. Given that \[ |XA| \cdot |XB| + r_1^2 = |XC| \cdot |XD| + r_2^2,\] prove that $P,Q,R,S$ are cyclic.
