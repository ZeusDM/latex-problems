A wedding is going to be held in a city with $25$ types of meals, to which some of the $2017$ citizens will be invited. All of the citizens like some meals and each meal is liked by at least one person. A \emph{suitable list} is a set of citizens, such that each meal is liked by at least one person in the set. A \emph{kamber group} is a set that contains at least one person from each suitable list. Given a kamber group, which has no subset (other than itself) that is also a kamber group, prove that there exists a meal, which is liked by everyone in the group.
