Let $M=\{1,2,...,2013\}$ and let $ \Gamma $ be a circle. For every nonempty subset $ B $ of the set $ M $,  denote by $ S(B) $ sum of elements of the set $ B $,  and define $ S(\varnothing)=0 $ ( $ \varnothing $ is the empty set ).

Determine if is it possible to join every subset $ B $ of $ M $ with some point $ A $ on the circle $ \Gamma $ so that following conditions are fulfilled:

\begin{enumerate}[label = \roman*.]
	\item Different subsets are joined with different points;
	\item All joined points are vertices of a regular polygon;
	\item If $ A_1,A_2,...,A_k $ are some of the joined points, $ k>2 $ , such that $ A_1A_2...A_k $ is a regular $ k-gon $,  then $ 2014 $ divides $ S(B_1)+S(B_2)+...+S(B_k) $.
