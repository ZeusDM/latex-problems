A special number is a positive integer $n$ for which there exists positive integers $a$,  $b$,  $c$,  and $d$ with \[ n = \frac {a^3 + 2b^3} {c^3 + 2d^3}. \] Prove that
\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item there are infinitely many special numbers;
	\item $2014$ is not a special number.
\end{enumerate}
