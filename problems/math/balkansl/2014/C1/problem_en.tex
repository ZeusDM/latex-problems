The International Mathematical Olympiad is being organized in Japan, where a folklore belief is that the number $4$ brings bad luck. The opening ceremony takes place at the Grand Theatre where each row has the capacity of $55$ seats. What is the maximum number of contestants that can be seated in a single row with the restriction that no two of them are $4$ seats apart (so that bad luck during the competition is avoided)?
