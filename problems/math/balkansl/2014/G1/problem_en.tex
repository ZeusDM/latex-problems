Let $ABC$ be an isosceles triangle, in which $AB=AC$ , and let $M$ and $N$ be two points on the sides $BC$ and $AC$,  respectively such that $\angle BAM = \angle MNC$. Suppose that the lines $MN$ and $AB$ intersects at $P$. Prove that the bisectors of the angles $\angle BAM$ and $\angle BPM$ intersects at a point lying on the line $BC$.
