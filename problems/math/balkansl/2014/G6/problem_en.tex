In $\triangle ABC$ with $AB=AC$, $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$, $H$ is the projection of $M$ onto $AB$ and $D$ is arbitrary point on the side $AC$.Let $E$ be the intersection point of the parallel line through $B$ to $HD$ with the parallel line through $C$ to $AB$.Prove that $DM$ is the bisector of $\angle ADE$.
