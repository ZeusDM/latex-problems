Integers are written in the cells of a table $2010 \times 2010$. Adding $1$ to all the numbers in a row or in a column is called a \textit{move}. We say that a table is \textit{equilibrium} if one can obtain after finitely many moves a table in which all the numbers are equal.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Find the largest positive integer $n$, for which there exists an \textit{equilibrium} table containing the numbers $2^0, 2^1, \ldots , 2^n$.
	\item For this $n$, find the maximal number that may be contained in such a table.
\end{itemize}
