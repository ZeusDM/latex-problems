The incircle of a triangle $A_0B_0C_0$ touches the sides $B_0C_0,C_0A_0,A_0B_0$ at the points $A,B,C$ respectively, and the incircle of the triangle $ABC$ with incenter $ I$ touches the sides $BC,CA, AB$ at the points $A_1, B_1,C_1$, respectively. Let $\sigma(ABC)$ and $\sigma(A_1B_1C)$ be the areas of the triangles $ABC$ and $A_1B_1C$ respectively. Show that if $\sigma(ABC) = 2 \sigma(A_1B_1C)$ , then the lines $AA_0, BB_0,IC_1$ pass through a common point .
