In a soccer tournament each team plays exactly one game with all others. The winner gets $3$ points, the loser gets $0$ and each team gets $1$ point in case of a draw. It is known that $n$ teams ($n \geq 3$) participated in the tournament and the final classification is given by the arithmetical progression of the points, the last team having only 1 point.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Prove that this configuration is unattainable when $n=12$
	\item Find all values of $n$ and all configurations when this is possible
\end{itemize}
