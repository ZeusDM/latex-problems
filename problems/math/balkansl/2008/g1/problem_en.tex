In acute angled triangle $ABC$ we denote by $a,b,c$ the side lengths, by $m_a,m_b,m_c$ the median lengths and by $r_{b}c,r_{ca},r_{ab}$ the radii of the circles tangents to two sides and to circumscribed circle of the triangle, respectively. Prove that
$$\frac{m_a^2}{r_{bc}}+\frac{m_b^2}{r_{ab}}+\frac{m_c^2}{r_{ab}} \ge \frac{27\sqrt3}{8}\sqrt[3]{abc}$$
