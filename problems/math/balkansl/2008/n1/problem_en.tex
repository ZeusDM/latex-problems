Prove that for every natural number $a$, there exists a natural number that has the number $a$ (the sequence of digits that constitute $a$) at its beginning, and which decreases $a$ times when $a$ is moved from its beginning to it end (any number zeros that appear in the beginning of the number obtained in this way are to be removed).

Example
\begin{itemize}
	\item $a=4$, then $\underline{4}10256= 4 \cdot 10256\underline{4}$
	\item $a=46$, then $\underline{46}0100021743857360295716= 46 \cdot 100021743857360295716\underline{46}$
\end{itemize}
