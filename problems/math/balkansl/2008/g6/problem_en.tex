On triangle $ABC$ the $AM$ ($M\in BC$) is median and $BB_1$ and $CC_1$ ($B_1 \in AC,C_1 \in AB$) are altitudes. The stright line $d$ is perpendicular to $AM$ at the point $A$ and intersect the lines $BB_1$ and $CC_1$ at the points $E$ and $F$ respectively. Let denoted with $\omega$ the circle passing through the points $E, M$ and $F$ and with $\omega_1$ and with $\omega_2$ the circles that are tangent to segment $EF$ and with $\omega$ at the arc $EF$ which is not contain the point $M$. If the points $P$ and $Q$ are intersections points for $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ then prove that the points $P, Q$ and $M$ are collinear.
