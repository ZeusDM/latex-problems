Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral and $S$ an arbitrary point in its interior. Let also $E$ be the symmetric point of $S$ with respect to the midpoint $K$ of the side $AB$ and let $Z$  be the symmetric point of $S$ with respect to the midpoint $L$ of the side $CD$. Prove that  $(AECZ) = (EBZD) = (ABCD)$.
