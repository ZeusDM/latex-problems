A  $ 9 \times 12$ rectangle is partitioned into unit squares. The centers of all the unit squares, except for the four corner squares and eight squares sharing a common side with one of them, are coloured red. Is it possible to label these red centres $ C_1,C_2,\ldots ,C_{96}$ in such way that the following to conditions are both fulfilled
i) the distances $C_1C_2,\ldots ,C_{95}C_{96}, C_{96}C_{1}$ are all equal to $ \sqrt {13}$,
ii) the closed broken line $ C_1C_2\ldots C_{96}C_1$ has a centre of symmetry?
