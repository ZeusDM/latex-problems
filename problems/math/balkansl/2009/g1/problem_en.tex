In the triangle $ABC, \angle  BAC$ is acute, the angle bisector of $\angle  BAC$ meets $BC$ at $D, K$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$, and $\angle ADB = 45^o$. Point $P$ lies between $K$ and $C$ such that $\angle KDP = 30^o$. Point $Q$ lies on the ray $DP$ such that  $DQ = DK$. The perpendicular at $P$ to $AC$ meets $KD$ at $L$. Prove that $PL^2 = DQ \cdot PQ$.
