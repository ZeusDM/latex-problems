Suppose that $k$ is a positive integer. A bijective map $f : Z \to Z$ is said to be $k$-\textit{jumpy } if $|f(z) - z| \le k$ for all integers $z$.
Is it that case that for every $k$, each $k$-jumpy map is a composition of $1$-jumpy maps?
\textit{It is well known that this is the case when the support of the map is finite.}
