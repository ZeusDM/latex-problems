A closed, non-self-intersecting broken line $L$ is drawn over a $(2n+1) \times (2n+1)$ chessboard in such a way that the set of L's vertices coincides with the set of the vertices of the boardâ€™s squares and every edge in $L$ is a side of some board square. All board squares lying in the interior of $L$ are coloured in red. Prove that the number of neighbouring pairs of red squares in every row of the board is even.
