Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\omega$ . Point $D$ lies on the arc $BC$ του $\omega$ and is different than $B,C$ and the midpoint of arc $BC$.  Tangent of $\Gamma$ on $D$ intersects lines $BC,CA,AB$ at $A',B',C'$,  respectively. Lines $BB'$ and $CC'$ intersect at $E$. Line $AA'$ intersects again the circle  $\omega$ at $F$. Prove that points $D,E,F$ are collinear.
