Positive integer $m$ shall be called anagram  of positive $n$ if every digit $a$ appears as many times in the decimal representation of $m$ as it appears in the decimal representation of $n$ also. Is it possible to find $4$ different positive integers such that each of the four to be anagram  of the sum of the other $3$?
