A chessboard $1000 \times 1000$ is covered by dominoes $1 \times 10$ that can be rotated. We don't know which is the cover, but we are looking for it. For this reason, we choose a few $N$ cells of the chessboard, for which we know the position of the dominoes that cover them.

Which is the minimum $N$ such that after the choice of $N$ and knowing the dominoed that cover them, we can be sure and for the rest of the cover?
