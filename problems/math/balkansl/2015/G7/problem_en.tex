Let scalene triangle $ABC$ have orthocentre $H$ and circumcircle $\Gamma$. $AH$ meets $\Gamma$ at $D$ distinct from $A$. $BH$ and $CH$ meet $CA$ and $AB$ at $E$ and $F$ respectively, and $EF$ meets $BC$ at $P$. The tangents to $\Gamma$ at $B$ and $C$ meet at $T$. Show that $AP$ and $DT$ are concurrent on the circumcircle of $AFE$.
