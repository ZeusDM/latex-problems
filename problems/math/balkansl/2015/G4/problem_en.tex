Let $\triangle{ABC}$ be a scalene triangle with incentre $I$ and circumcircle $\omega$. Lines $AI, BI, CI$ intersect $\omega$ for the second time at points $D, E, F$,  respectively. The parallel lines from $I$ to the sides $BC, AC, AB$ intersect $EF, DF, DE$ at points $K, L, M$,  respectively. Prove that the points $K, L, M$ are collinear.
