Isaak and Jeremy play the following game.

Isaak says to Jeremy that he thinks a few $2^n$  integers $k_1,..,k_{2^n}$.

Jeremy asks questions of the form: ``Is it true that $k_i<k_j$ ?'' in which Isaak answers by always telling the truth.

After $n2^{n-1}$ questions, Jeramy must decide whether numbers of Isaak are all distinct each other or not.

Prove that Jeremy has no way to be ``sure'' for his final decision.
