Let $d$ be an even positive integer.

John writes the numbers $1^2 ,3^2 ,\ldots,(2n-1)^2 $ on the blackboard and then chooses three of them,  let them be ${a_1}, {a_2}, {a_3}$,  erases them and writes the number $1+ \displaystyle\sum_{1\le i<j\leq 3} |{a_i} -{a_j}|$

He continues until two numbers remain written on on the blackboard.

Prove that the sum of squares of those two numbers is different than the numbers  $1^2 ,3^2 ,\ldots,(2n-1)^2$.
