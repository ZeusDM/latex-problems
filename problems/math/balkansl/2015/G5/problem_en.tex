Quadrilateral $ABCD$ is given with $AD \nparallel BC$. The midpoints of $AD$ and $BC$ are denoted by $M$ and $N$,  respectively. The line $MN$ intersects the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ in points $K$ and $L$,  respectively. Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles $AKM$ and $BNL$ have common point on the line $AB$.
