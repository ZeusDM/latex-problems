$ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. The lines $AD$ and $BC$ meet at X, and the lines $AB$ and $CD$ meet at $Y$ . The line joining the midpoints $M$ and $N$ of the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$, respectively, meets the internal bisector of angle $AXB$ at $P$ and the external bisector of angle $BYC$ at $Q$. Prove that $PXQY$ is a rectangle
