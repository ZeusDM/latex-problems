Let $n$ be a positive integer. Let $P_n=\{2^n,2^{n-1}\cdot 3, 2^{n-2}\cdot 3^2, \dots, 3^n \}.$ For each subset $X$ of $P_n$, we write $S_X$ for the sum of all elements of $X$, with the convention that $S_{\emptyset}=0$ where $\emptyset$ is the empty set. Suppose that $y$ is a real number with $0 \leq y \leq 3^{n+1}-2^{n+1}.$
Prove that there is a subset $Y$ of $P_n$ such that  $0 \leq y-S_Y < 2^n$
