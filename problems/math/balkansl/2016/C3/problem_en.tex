The plane is divided into squares by two sets of parallel lines, forming an infinite grid. Each unit square is coloured with one of $1201$ colours so that no rectangle with perimeter $100$ contains two squares of the same colour. Show that no rectangle of size $1\times1201$ or $1201\times1$ contains two squares of the same colour.Note: Any rectangle is assumed here to have sides contained in the lines of the grid.(Bulgaria - Nikolay Beluhov)
