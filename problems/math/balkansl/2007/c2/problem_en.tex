Let $\mathcal{F}$ be the set of all the functions $f : \mathcal{P}(S) \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $X, Y \subseteq S$, we have $f(X \cap Y) = \min (f(X), f(Y))$, where $S$ is a finite set (and $\mathcal{P}(S)$ is the set of its subsets). Find
\[\max_{f \in \mathcal{F}}| \textrm{Im}(f) |. \]
