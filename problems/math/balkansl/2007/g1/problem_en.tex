Let $\omega$ be a circle with center $O$ and let $A$ be a point outside $\omega$. The tangents from $A$ touch $\omega$ at points $B$, and $C$. Let $D$ be the point at which the line $AO$ intersects the circle such that $O$ is between $A$ and $D$. Denote by $X$ the orthogonal projection of $B$ onto $CD$, by $Y$ the midpoint of the segment $BX$ and by $Z$ the second point of intersection of the line $DY$ with $\omega$. Prove that $ZA$ and $ZC$ are perpendicular to each other.
