Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $AB<AC<BC$  and let $D$ be a point on it's extension of $BC$ towards $C$. Circle $c_1$,  with center $A$ and radius $AD$,  intersects lines $AC,AB$ and $CB$ at points $E,F$,  and $G$ respectively. Circumscribed circle $c_2$ of triangle $AFG$ intersects again lines $FE,BC,GE$ and $DF$ at points $J,H,H' $ and $J'$  respectively. Circumscribed circle $c_3$ of triangle $ADE$ intersects again lines $FE,BC,GE$ and $DF$ at points $I,K,K' $ and $I' $  respectively. Prove that the quadrilaterals $HIJK$ and $H'I'J'K '$ are cyclic and the centers of their circumscribed circles coincide.
