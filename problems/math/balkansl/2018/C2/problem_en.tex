Alice and Bob play the following game: They start with non-empty piles of coins. Taking turns, with Alice playing first, each player choose a pile with an even number of coins and moves half of the coins of this pile to the other pile.  The game ends if a player cannot move, in which case the other player wins.

Determine all pairs $(a,b)$ of positive integers such that if initially the two piles have $a$  and $b$ coins respectively, then Bob has a winning strategy.
