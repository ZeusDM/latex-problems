Let $P$ be an interior point of triangle $ABC$. Let $a,b,c$ be the sidelengths of triangle $ABC$ and let $p$ be it's semiperimeter. Find the maximum possible value of$$ \min\left(\frac{PA}{p-a},\frac{PB}{p-b},\frac{PC}{p-c}\right)$$taking into consideration all possible choices of triangle $ABC$ and of point $P$.
