Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle and let $M$ be the midpoint of side $BC$. Let $D,E$ be the excircles of triangles $AMB,AMC$ respectively, towards $M$. Circumcirscribed circle of triangle $ABD$ intersects line $BC$ at points $B$ and $F$. Circumcirscribed circles of triangle $ACE$ intersects line $BC$ at points $C$ and $G$. Prove that $BF=CG$.
