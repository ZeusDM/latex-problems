Let $n$ be an integer number greater than $2$, let $x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}$ be $n$ positive real numbers such that
\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{x_{i}+1}=1\]
and let $k$ be a real number greater than $1$. Show that:
\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{x_{i}^{k}+1}\ge\frac{n}{(n-1)^{k}+1}\]
and  determine the cases of equality.
