Given a triangle $ABC$, the line parallel to the side $BC$ and tangent to the incircle of the triangle meets the sides $AB$ and $AC$ at the points $A_1$ and $A_2$ ,  the points $B_1, B_2$ and $C_1, C_2$ are dened similarly. Show that
$$AA_1 \cdot  AA_2 + BB_1 \cdot BB_2 + CC_1 \cdot CC_2  \ge \frac19 (AB^2 + BC^2 + CA^2)$$
