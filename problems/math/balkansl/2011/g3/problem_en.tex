Given a triangle $ABC$, let $D$ be the midpoint of the side $AC$ and let $M$ be the point that divides the segment $BD$ in the ratio $1/2$; that is, $MB/MD=1/2$. The rays $AM$ and $CM$ meet the sides $BC$ and $AB$ at points $E$ and $F$, respectively. Assume the two rays perpendicular: $AM\perp CM$. Show that the quadrangle $AFED$ is cyclic if and only if the median from $A$ in triangle $ABC$ meets the line $EF$ at a point situated on the circle $ABC$.
