Is it possible to partition the set of positive integer numbers into two classes, none of which contains an infinite arithmetic sequence (with a positive ratio)? What is we impose the extra condition that in each class $\mathcal{C}$ of the partition, the set of difference
\begin{align*} \left\{ \min \{ n \in \mathcal{C} \mid n >m \} -m \mid m \in \mathcal{C} \right \} \end{align*}be bounded?
