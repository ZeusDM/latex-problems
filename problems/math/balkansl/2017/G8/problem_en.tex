Given an acute triangle  $ABC$ ($AC\ne AB$) and let $(C)$ be its circumcircle. The excircle $(C_1)$ corresponding to the vertex $A$,  of center $I_a$,  tangents to the side $BC$ at the point $D$ and to the extensions of the sides $AB,AC$ at the points $E,Z$ respectively. Let $I$ and $L$ are the intersection points of the circles $(C)$ and $(C_1)$,  $H$  the orthocenter of the triangle $EDZ$ and $N$ the midpoint of segment $EZ$. The parallel line through the point $l_a$ to the line $HL$ meets the line $HI$ at the point $G$. Prove that the perpendicular line $(e)$ through the point $N$ to the line $BC$ and the parallel line $(\delta)$ through the point $G$ to the line $IL$ meet each other on the line $HI_a$.
