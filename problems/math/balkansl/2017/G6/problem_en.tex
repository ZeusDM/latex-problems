Construct outside the acute-angled triangle $ABC$ the isosceles triangles $ABA_B, ABB_A , ACA_C,ACC_A ,BCB_C$ and $BCC_B$,  so that $$AB = AB_A = BA_B, AC = AC_A=CA_C, BC = BC_B = CB_C$$and $$\angle BAB_A = \angle ABA_B =\angle CAC_A=\angle ACA_C= \angle BCB_C =\angle CBC_B = a < 90^o$$.

Prove that the perpendiculars from $A$ to $B_AC_A$,  from $B$ to $A_BC_B$ and from $C$ to $A_CB_C$ are concurrent
