Let $ABC$ be an acute angled triangle with orthocenter $H$. centroid $G$ and circumcircle $\omega$. Let $D$ and  $M$ respectively be the intersection of lines $AH$ and $AG$ with side $BC$. Rays $MH$ and $DG$ interect $ \omega$ again at $P$ and $Q$ respectively. Prove that $PD$ and $QM$ intersect on  $\omega$.
