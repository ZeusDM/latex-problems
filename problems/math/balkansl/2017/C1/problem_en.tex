A grasshopper is sitting at an integer point in the Euclidean plane. Each second it jumps to another integer point in such a way that the jump vector is constant. A hunter that knows neither the starting point of the grasshopper nor the jump vector (but knows that the jump vector for each second is constant) wants to catch the grasshopper. Each second the hunter can choose one integer point in the plane and, if the grasshopper is there, he catches it. Can the hunter always catch the grasshopper in a finite amount of time?
