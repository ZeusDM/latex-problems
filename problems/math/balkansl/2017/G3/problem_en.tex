Consider an acute-angled triangle $ABC$  with $AB<AC$ and let $\omega$ be its circumscribed circle.  Let $t_B$ and $t_C$ be the tangents to the circle $\omega$ at points $B$ and $C$,  respectively, and let $L$ be their intersection.  The straight line passing through the point $B$ and parallel to $AC$ intersects $t_C$ in point $D$.  The straight line passing through the point $C$ and parallel to $AB$ intersects $t_B$ in point $E$.  The circumcircle of the triangle $BDC$ intersects $AC$ in $T$,  where $T$ is located between $A$ and $C$.  The circumcircle of the triangle $BEC$ intersects the line $AB$ (or its extension) in $S$,  where $B$ is located between $S$ and $A$. Prove that $ST$,  $AL$,  and $BC$ are concurrent.$\text{Vangelis Psychas and Silouanos Brazitikos}$
