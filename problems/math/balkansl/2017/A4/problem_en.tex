Let $M = \{(a,b,c)\in R^3 :0 <a,b,c<\frac12$  with  $a+b+c=1 \}$ and  $f: M\to  R$ given as  $$f(a,b,c)=4\left(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}+\frac{1}{c}\right)-\frac{1}{abc}$$Find the best (real) bounds $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $f(M) = \{f(a,b,c): (a,b,c)\in M\}\subseteq [\alpha,\beta]$ and determine whether any of them is achievable.
