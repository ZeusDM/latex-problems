Let $n,a,b,c$ be natural numbers. Every point on the coordinate plane with integer coordinates is colored in one of $n$ colors. Prove there exists $c$ triangles whose vertices are colored in the same color, which are pairwise congruent, and which have a side whose lenght is divisible by $a$ and a side whose lenght is divisible by $b$.
