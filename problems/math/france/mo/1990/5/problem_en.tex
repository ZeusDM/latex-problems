In a triangle $ABC$,
$\Gamma$ denotes the excircle corresponding to $A$;
$A', B', C'$ are the points of tangency of $\Gamma$ with $BC$, $CA$, $AB$ respectively;
and $S$ denotes the region of the plane determined by segments $AB'$, $AC'$ and the arc $\wideparen{C'A'B'}$ of $\Gamma$.
Prove that, given a perimeter $p$, there is a triangle $ABC$ of a given perimeter $p$ for which the area of $S$ is maximum. For this triangle, give an approximate measure of the angle at $A$.
