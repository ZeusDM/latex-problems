Given are four distinct points $A, B, E, P$ so that $P$ is the middle of $AE$ and $B$ is on the segment $AP$. Let $k_1$ and $k_2$ be two circles passing through $A$ and $B$. Let $t_1$ and $t_2$ be the tangents of $k_1$ and $k_2$,  respectively, to $A$.Let $C$ be the intersection point of $t_2$ and $k_1$ and $Q$ be the intersection point of $t_2$ and the circumscribed circle of the triangle $ECB$. Let $D$ be the intersection posit of $t_1$ and $k_2$ and $R$ be the intersection point of $t_1$ and the circumscribed circle of triangle $BDE$. Prove that $P, Q, R$ are collinear.
