\playerA{Players A} and \playerB{B} play a game. They are given a box with $n\ge1$ candies. \playerA{A} starts first. On a move, if in the box there are $k$ candies, the player chooses positive integer $l$ so that $l \le k$ and $(l, k) = 1$,  and eats $l$ candies from the box. The player who eats the last candy wins. Determine who has winning strategy, in terms of $n$.
