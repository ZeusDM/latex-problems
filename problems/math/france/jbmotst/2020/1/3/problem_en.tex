Let $n$ be a nonzero natural number.  A function $f âˆ¶ \RR\to\RR$ is \emph{$n$-positive} if, for any real numbers $x_1, x_2,...,x_n$ with the property that $x_1+x_2+...+x_n = 0$, the inequality $f(x_1)+f(x_2)+...+f(x_n)\ge 0$ is true.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item Is it true that any $2020$-positive function is also $1010$-positive?
	\item Is it true that any $1010$-positive function is $2020$-positive?
\end{enumerate}
