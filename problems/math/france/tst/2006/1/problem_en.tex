Let $ABCD$ be a square and let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of $ABCD$. $M$ is a point of $\Gamma$ belonging to the arc $CD$ which doesn't contain $A$. $P$ and $R$ are respectively the intersection points of $(AM)$ with $[BD]$ and $[CD]$,  $Q$ and $S$ are respectively the intersection points of $(BM)$ with $[AC]$ and $[DC]$.

Prove that $(PS)$ and $(QR)$ are perpendicular.
