Given a triangle $ABC$ satisfying $AC+BC=3\cdot AB$. The incircle of triangle $ABC$ has center $I$ and touches the sides $BC$ and $CA$ at the points $D$ and $E$,  respectively. Let $K$ and $L$ be the reflections of the points $D$ and $E$ with respect to $I$. Prove that the points $A$,  $B$,  $K$,  $L$ lie on one circle.
