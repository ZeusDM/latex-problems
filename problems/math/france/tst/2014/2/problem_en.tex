Two circles $O_1$ and $O_2$ intersect each other at $M$ and $N$. The common tangent to two circles nearer to $M$ touch $O_1$ and $O_2$ at $A$ and $B$ respectively. Let $C$ and $D$ be the reflection of $A$ and $B$ respectively with respect to $M$. The circumcircle of the triangle $DCM$ intersect circles $O_1$ and $O_2$ respectively at points $E$ and $F$ (both distinct from $M$). Show that the circumcircles of triangles $MEF$ and $NEF$ have same radius length.
