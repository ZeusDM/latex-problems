Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram. Let $M$ be a point on the side $AB$ and $N$ be a point on the side $BC$ such that the segments $AM$ and $CN$ have equal lengths and are non-zero. The lines $AN$ and $CM$ meet at $Q$.

Prove that the line $DQ$ is the bisector of the angle $\measuredangle ADC$.Alternative formulation. Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram. Let $M$ and $N$ be points on the sides $AB$ and $BC$,  respectively, such that $AM=CN\neq 0$. The lines $AN$ and $CM$ intersect at a point $Q$.

Prove that the point $Q$ lies on the bisector of the angle $\measuredangle ADC$.
