In an acute-angled triangle $ABC$,  $A_1$ and $B_1$ are the feet of the altitudes from $A$ and $B$ respectively, and $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$.

a) Prove that $MA_1$ is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle $A_1B_1C$.

b) Prove that the circumcircles of triangles $A_1B_1C,BMA_1$,  and $AMB_1$ have a common point.
