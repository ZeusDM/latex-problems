$10$ cities are connected by one-way air routes in a way so that each city can be reached from any other by several connected flights. Let $n$ be the smallest number of flights needed for a tourist to visit every city and return to the starting city. Clearly $n$ depends on the flight schedule. Find the largest $n$ and the corresponding flight schedule.
