A lattice point in the coordinate plane with origin $O$ is called invisible if the segment $OA$ contains a lattice point other than $O,A$. Let $L$ be a positive integer. Show that there exists a square with side length $L$ and sides parallel to the coordinate axes, such that all points in the square are invisible.
