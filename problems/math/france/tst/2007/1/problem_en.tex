For a positive integer $a$,  $a'$ is the integer obtained by the following method: the decimal writing of $a'$ is the inverse of the decimal writing of $a$ (the decimal writing of $a'$ can begin by zeros, but not the one of $a$); for instance if $a=2370$,  $a'=0732$,  that is $732$.

Let $a_{1}$ be a positive integer, and $(a_{n})_{n \geq 1}$ the sequence defined by $a_{1}$ and the following formula for $n \geq 1$:\[a_{n+1}=a_{n}+a'_{n}. \]

Can $a_{7}$ be prime?
