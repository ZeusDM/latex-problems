A point $D$ is chosen on the side $AC$ of a triangle $ABC$ with $\angle C < \angle A < 90^\circ$ in such a way that $BD=BA$.  The incircle of $ABC$ is tangent to $AB$ and $AC$ at points $K$ and $L$,  respectively.  Let $J$ be the incenter of triangle $BCD$.  Prove that the line $KL$ intersects the line segment $AJ$ at its midpoint.
