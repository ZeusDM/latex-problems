Let $k>1$ be an integer. A function $f:\mathbb{N^*}\to\mathbb{N^*}$ is called $k$-tastrophic when for every integer $n>0$,  we have $f_k(n)=n^k$ where $f_k$ is the $k$-th iteration of $f$:\[f_k(n)=\underbrace{f\circ f\circ\cdots \circ f}_{k\text{ times}}(n)\]

For which $k$ does there exist a $k$-tastrophic function?
