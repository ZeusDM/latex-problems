Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with $AB\not= AC$. Let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle, $H$ the orthocentre and $O$ the centre of $\Gamma$. $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$. The line $AM$ meets $\Gamma$ again at $N$ and the circle with diameter $AM$ crosses $\Gamma$ again at $P$. Prove that the lines $AP,BC,OH$ are concurrent if and only if $AH=HN$.
