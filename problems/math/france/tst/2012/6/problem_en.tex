Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral whose sides $AD$ and $BC$ are not parallel. Suppose that the circles with diameters $AB$ and $CD$ meet at points $E$ and $F$ inside the quadrilateral. Let $\omega_E$ be the circle through the feet of the perpendiculars from $E$ to the lines $AB,BC$ and $CD$. Let $\omega_F$ be the circle through  the feet of the perpendiculars from $F$ to the lines $CD,DA$ and $AB$. Prove that the midpoint of the segment $EF$ lies on the line through the two intersections of $\omega_E$ and $\omega_F$.
