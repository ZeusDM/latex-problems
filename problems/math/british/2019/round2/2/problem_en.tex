For some integer $n$, a set of $n^2$ magical chess pieces arrange themselves on a square $n^2 \times n^2$ chessboard composed of $n^4$ unit squares. At a signal, the chess pieces all teleport to another square of the chessboard such that the distance between the centres of their old and new squares is $n$. The chess pieces win if, both before and after the signal, there are no two chess pieces in the same row or column. For which values of $n$ can the chess pieces win?
