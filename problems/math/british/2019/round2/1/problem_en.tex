Let $ABC$ be a triangle. Let $\ell$ be the line through $B$ perpendicular to $AB$. The perpendicular from $A$ to $BC$ meets $\ell$ at the point $D$. The perpendicular bisector of $BC$ meets $\ell$ at the point $P$. Let $E$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ to $AC$. Prove that triangle $BPE$ is isosceles.
