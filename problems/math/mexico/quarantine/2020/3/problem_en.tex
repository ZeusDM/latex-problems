Let $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ be circles intersecting at points $A$ and $B$. A line through $A$ intersects $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ at $C$ and $D$ respectively. Let $P$ be the intersection of the lines tangent to $\Gamma_1$ at $A$ and $C$, and let $Q$ be the intersection of the lines tangent to $\Gamma_2$ at $A$ and $D$. Let $X$ be the second intersection point of the circumcircles of $BCP$ and $BDQ$, and let $Y$ be the intersection of lines $AB$ and $PQ$. Prove that $C$, $D$, $X$ and $Y$ are concyclic.
