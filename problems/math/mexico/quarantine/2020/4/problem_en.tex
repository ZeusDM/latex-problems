Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with orthocenter $H$. Let $A_1$, $B_1$ and $C_1$ be the feet of the altitudes of triangle $ABC$ opposite to vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively. Let $B_2$ and $C_2$ be the midpoints of $BB_1$ and $CC_1$, respectively. Let $O$ be the intersection of lines $BC_2$ and $CB_2$. Prove that $O$ is the circumcenter of triangle $ABC$ if and only if $H$ is the midpoint of $AA_1$.
