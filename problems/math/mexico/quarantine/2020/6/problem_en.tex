Oriol has a finite collection of cards, each one with a positive integer written on it. We say the collection is $n$-\textit{complete} if for any integer $k$ from $1$ to $n$ (inclusive), he can choose some cards such that the sum of the numbers on them is exactly $k$. Suppose that Oriol's collection is $n$-complete, but it stops being $n$-complete if any card is removed from it. What is the maximum possible sum of the numbers on all the cards?
