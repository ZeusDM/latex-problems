Let $\pi$ be a random permutation of $1, 2, \dots, n$. Fix a positive integer $1 \le k \le n$.
What is the probability that in the disjoint cycle decomposition of $\pi$, the length of the cycle containing $1$ is $k$?
In other words, what is the probability that $k$ is the least positive integer for which $\pi^k(1) = 1$?
