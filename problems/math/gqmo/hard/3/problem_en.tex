We call a set of integers $\textit{special}$ if it has $4$ elements and can be partitioned into $2$ disjoint subsets $\{ a,b \}$ and $\{ c, d \}$ such that $ab - cd = 1$. For every positive integer $n$,  prove that the set $\{ 1, 2, \dots, 4n \}$ cannot be partitioned into $n$ disjoint special sets.
