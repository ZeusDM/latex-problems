Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incentre $I$. The incircle of the triangle $ABC$ touches the sides $AC$ and $AB$ at points $E$ and $F$ respectively. Let $\ell_B$ and $\ell_C$ be the tangents to the circumcircle of $BIC$ at $B$ and $C$ respectively. Show that there is a circle tangent to $EF, \ell_B$ and $\ell_C$ with centre on the line $BC$.
