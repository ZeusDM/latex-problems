Each integer in $\{1, 2, 3, . . . , 2020\}$ is coloured in such a way that, for all positive integers $a$ and $b$

such that $a + b \leq 2020$,  the numbers $a$,  $b$ and $a + b$ are not coloured with three different colours.

Determine the maximum number of colours that can be used.Massimiliano Foschi, Italy
