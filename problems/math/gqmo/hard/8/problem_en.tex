Let $ABC$ be an acute scalene triangle, with the feet of $A,B,C$ onto $BC,CA,AB$ being $D,E,F$ respectively. Let $W$ be a point inside $ABC$ whose reflections over $BC,CA,AB$ are $W_a,W_b,W_c$ respectively. Finally, let $N$ and $I$ be the circumcenter and the incenter of $W_aW_bW_c$ respectively. Prove that, if $N$ coincides with the nine-point center of $DEF$,  the line $WI$ is parallel to the Euler line of $ABC$.
