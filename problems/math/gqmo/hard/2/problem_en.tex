Geoff has an infinite stock of sweets, which come in $n$ flavours. He arbitrarily distributes some of the sweets amongst $n$ children (a child can get sweets of any subset of all flavours, including the empty set). Call a distribution $k-\textit{nice}$ if every group of $k$ children together has sweets in at least $k$ flavours. Find all subsets $S$ of $\{ 1, 2, \dots, n \}$ such that if a distribution of sweets is $s$-nice for all $s \in S$,  then it is $s$-nice for all $s \in \{ 1, 2, \dots, n \}$.
