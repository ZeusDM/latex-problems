Prove that, for all sufficiently large integers $n$,  there exists $n$ numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ satisfying the following three conditions:

Each number $a_i$ is equal to either $-1, 0$ or $1$.At least $\frac{2n}{5}$ of the numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ are non-zero.The sum $\frac{a_1}{1} + \frac{a_2}{2} + \dots + \frac{a_n}{n}$ is $0$.$\textit{Note: Results with 2/5 replaced by a constant } c \textit{ will be awarded points depending on the value of } c$
