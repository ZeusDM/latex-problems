Let $A$ and $B$ be two distinct points in the plane. Let $M$ be the midpoint of the segment $AB$,  and let $\omega$ be a circle that goes through $A$ and $M$. Let $T$ be a point on $\omega$ such that the line $BT$ is tangent to $\omega$. Let $X$ be a point (other than $B$) on the line $AB$ such that $TB = TX$,  and let $Y$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ onto the line $BT$.

Prove that the lines $AT$ and $XY$ are parallel.Navneel Singhal, India
