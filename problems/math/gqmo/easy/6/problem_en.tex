For every integer $n$ not equal to $1$ or $-1$,  define $S(n)$ as the smallest integer greater than $1$ that divides $n$. In particular, $S(0)=2$. We also define $S(1) = S(-1) = 1$.

Let $f$ be a non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients such that $S(f(n)) \leq S(n)$ for every positive integer $n$. Prove that $f(0)=0$.Note: A non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients is a function of the form $f(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \ldots + a_k x^k$,  where $k$ is a positive integer and $a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_k$ are integers such that $a_k \neq 0$.Pitchayut Saengrungkongka, Thailand
