Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers such that $k\leq 2^n$. Banana and Corona are playing the following variant of the guessing game. First, Banana secretly picks an integer $x$ such that $1\leq x\leq n$. Corona will attempt to determine $x$ by asking some questions, which are described as follows. In each turn, Corona chooses $k$ distinct subsets of $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ and, for each chosen set $S$,  asks the question  "Is $x$ in the set $S$?''.

Banana picks one of these $k$ questions and tells both the question and its answer to Corona, who can then start another turn.

Find all pairs $(n,k)$ such that, regardless of Banana's actions, Corona could determine $x$ in finitely many turns with absolute certainty.Pitchayut Saengrungkongka, Thailand
