For all real numbers $x$,  we denote by $\lfloor x \rfloor$ the largest integer that does not exceed $x$. Find all functions $f$ that are defined on the set of all real numbers, take real values, and satisfy the equality\[f(x + y) = (-1)^{\lfloor y \rfloor} f(x) + (-1)^{\lfloor x \rfloor} f(y)\]for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.Navneel Singhal, India
