An integer 
$N \ge 2$
 is given. A collection of 
$N(N + 1)$
 soccer players, no two of whom are of the same height, stand in a row. Sir Alex wants to remove 
$N(N - 1)$
 players from this row leaving a new row of 
$2N$
 players in which the following 
$N$
 conditions hold:
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item[($1$)] no one stands between the two tallest players,
    \item[($2$)] no one stands between the third and fourth tallest players,
    \item[$\vdots\;\;$]
    \item[($N$)] no one stands between the two shortest players.
\end{itemize}

Show that this is always possible.
