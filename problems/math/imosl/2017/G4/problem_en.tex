In triangle 
$ABC$,
 let 
$\omega$
 be the excircle opposite to 
$A$.
 Let 
$D, E$
 and 
$F$
 be the points where 
$\omega$
 is tangent to 
$BC, CA$,
 and 
$AB$,
 respectively. The circle 
$AEF$
 intersects line 
$BC$
 at 
$P$
 and 
$Q$.
 Let 
$M$
 be the midpoint of 
$AD$.
 Prove that the circle 
$MPQ$
 is tangent to 
$\omega$.
