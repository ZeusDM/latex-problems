Let 
$R$
 and 
$S$
 be different points on a circle 
$\Omega$
 such that 
$RS$
 is not a diameter. Let 
$\ell$
 be the tangent line to 
$\Omega$
 at 
$R$.
 Point 
$T$
 is such that 
$S$
 is the midpoint of the line segment 
$RT$.
 Point 
$J$
 is chosen on the shorter arc 
$RS$
 of 
$\Omega$
 so that the circumcircle 
$\Gamma$
 of triangle 
$JST$
 intersects 
$\ell$
 at two distinct points. Let 
$A$
 be the common point of 
$\Gamma$
 and 
$\ell$
 that is closer to 
$R$.
 Line 
$AJ$
 meets 
$\Omega$
 again at 
$K$.
 Prove that the line 
$KT$
 is tangent to 
$\Gamma$.
