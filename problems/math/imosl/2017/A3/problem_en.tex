Let 
$S$
 be a finite set, and let 
$\mathcal{A}$
 be the set of all functions from 
$S$
 to 
$S$.
Let 
$f$
 be an element of 
$\mathcal{A}$
,
 and let 
$T=f(S)$
 be the image of 
$S$
 under 
$f$.
 Suppose that 
$f\circ g\circ f\ne g\circ f\circ g$
 for every 
$g$
 in 
$\mathcal{A}$
 with 
$g\ne f$.
 Show that 
$f(T)=T$.
