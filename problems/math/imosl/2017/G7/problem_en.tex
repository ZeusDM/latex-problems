A convex  quadrilateral 
$ABCD$
 has an inscribed circle with center 
$I$.
 Let 
$I_a, I_b, I_c$
 and 
$I_d$
 be the incenters of the triangles 
$DAB, ABC, BCD$
 and 
$CDA$,
 respectively. Suppose that the common external tangents of the circles 
$AI_bI_d$
 and 
$CI_bI_d$
 meet at 
$X$,
 and the common external tangents of the circles 
$BI_aI_c$
 and 
$DI_aI_c$
 meet at 
$Y$.
 Prove that 
$\angle{XIY}=90^{\circ}$.
