Find the smallest positive integer 
$n$
 or show no such 
$n$
 exists, with the following property: there are infinitely many distinct 
$n$
-
tuples of positive rational numbers 
$(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$
 such that both
$$a_1+a_2+\dots +a_n \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{a_1} + \frac{1}{a_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{a_n}$$
are integers.
