Let 
$n\ge3$
 be an integer. Two regular 
$n$-gons 
$\mathcal{A}$
 and 
$\mathcal{B}$
 are given in the plane. Prove that the vertices of 
$\mathcal{A}$
 that lie inside 
$\mathcal{B}$
 or on its boundary are consecutive.

(That is, prove that there exists a line separating those vertices of 
$\mathcal{A}$
 that lie inside 
$\mathcal{B}$
 or on its boundary from the other vertices of 
$\mathcal{A}$.)
