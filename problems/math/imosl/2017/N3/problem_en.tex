Determiner all integers 
$ n\geq 2$
 having the following property: for any integers 
$a_1,a_2,\ldots, a_n$
 whose sum is not divisible by 
$n$
,
 there exists an index 
$1 \leq i \leq n$
 such that none of the numbers 
$$a_i,a_i+a_{i+1},\ldots,a_i+a_{i+1}+\ldots+a_{i+n-1}$$
is divisible by 
$n$
.
 Here, we let 
$a_i=a_{i-n}$
 when 
$i  >n$
.
