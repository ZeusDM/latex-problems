Let 
$ABCC_1B_1A_1$
 be a convex hexagon such that 
$AB=BC$,
 and suppose that the line segments 
$AA_1, BB_1$,
 and 
$CC_1$
 have the same perpendicular bisector. Let the diagonals 
$AC_1$
 and 
$A_1C$
 meet at 
$D$,
 and denote by 
$\omega$
 the circle 
$ABC$.
 Let 
$\omega$
 intersect the circle 
$A_1BC_1$
 again at 
$E \neq B$.
 Prove that the lines 
$BB_1$
 and 
$DE$
 intersect on 
$\omega$.
