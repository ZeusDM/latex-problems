Let 
$ p \geq 2$
 be a prime number. Eduardo and Fernando play the following game making moves alternately: in each move, the current player chooses an index 
$i$
 in the set 
$\{1,2,\ldots, p-1 \}$
 that was not chosen before by either of the two players and then chooses an element 
$a_i$
 from the set 
$\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$
.
 Eduardo has the first move. The game ends after all the indices have been chosen .Then the following number is computed:
$$M=a_0+a_110+a_210^2+\cdots+a_{p-1}10^{p-1}= \sum_{i=0}^{p-1}a_i.10^i$$
.


The goal of Eduardo is to make  
$M$
 divisible by 
$p$
,
 and the goal of Fernando is to prevent this.


Prove that Eduardo has a winning strategy.
