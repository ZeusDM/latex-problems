Let 
$q$
 be a real number. Gugu has a napkin with ten distinct real numbers written on it, and he writes the following three lines of real numbers on the blackboard:

\begin{itemize}
\item In the first line, Gugu writes down every number of the form 
$a-b$
,
 where 
$a$
 and 
$b$
 are two (not necessarily distinct) numbers on his napkin.

\item In the second line, Gugu writes down every number of the form 
$qab$
,
 where 
$a$
 and 
$b$
 are
two (not necessarily distinct) numbers from the first line.

\item In the third line, Gugu writes down every number of the form 
$a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2$
,
 where 
$a, b, c, d$
 are four (not necessarily distinct) numbers from the first line.
\end{itemize}

Determine all values of 
$q$
 such that, regardless of the numbers on Gugu's napkin, every number in the second line is also a number in the third line.
