The answer is $\boxed{q\in\left\{-2,0,2\right\}}$. If $q=0$, this clearly works since $0=a^2+a^2-a^2-a^2$. Now, observe the identity \[2\left(x_1-x_2\right)\left(x_3-x_4\right)=\left(x_2-x_3\right)^2+\left(x_1-x_4\right)^2-\left(x_1-x_3\right)^2-\left(x_2-x_4\right)^2,\] so $q=2$ works. Negating the identity shows that $q=-2$ works.

For integers $i_j\in\left[1,10\right]$, $j=1,2,\ldots,8$, define the polynomial $T_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_8}\left(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{10}\right)$ as \[q\left(x_1-x_2\right)\left(x_3-x_4\right)-\left(x_{i_1}-x_{i_2}\right)^2-\left(x_{i_3}-x_{i_4}\right)^2+\left(x_{i_5}-x_{i_6}\right)^2+\left(x_{i_7}-x_{i_8}\right)^2.\] Then the polynomial \[\displaystyle\prod_{1\leq i<j\leq10}\left(x_i-x_j\right)\displaystyle\prod_{i_j=1}^{10}T_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_8}\left(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{10}\right)\] is identically zero because any choice of $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{10}$ outputs zero. This is because if the $x_i$ are pairwise distinct, then Gugu can write them on his napkin and one of the $T$ polynomials must output zero by the condition. Thus, one of the factors of this polynomial must be identically zero, so $T_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_8}\equiv0$ for some $i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_8$.

Now, look at the coefficient of $x_1x_3$ in $T_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_8}$. If none of the square terms are $\left(x_1-x_3\right)^2$, then the coefficient is $q$. If one of them is, then the coefficient is $q\pm2$. If two of them are, then the coefficient is either $q$ or $q\pm4$. If three of them are, then the coefficient is $q\pm2$. If four of them are, then the coefficient is $q$. Since the coefficient should be $0$, we have that $q=0,\pm2,\pm4$.

Suppose that $q=\pm4$. Then exactly two of the square terms are $\left(x_1-x_3\right)^2$, and they have the same sign. Then look at the coefficient of $x_2x_4$. A similar analysis shows that the other two square terms are $\left(x_2-x_4\right)^2$. But then the same analysis shows that two square terms must be $\left(x_2-x_3\right)^2$, which is impossible. So $q\neq\pm4$ and thus $q\in\left\{-2,0,2\right\}$.
