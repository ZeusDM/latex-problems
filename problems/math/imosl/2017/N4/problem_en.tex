Call a rational number 
short
 if it has finitely many digits in its decimal expansion. For a positive integer 
$m$
,
 we say that a positive integer 
$t$
 is 
$m-$
tastic
 if there exists a number 
$c\in \{1,2,3,\ldots ,2017\}$
 such that 
$\dfrac{10^t-1}{c\cdot m}$
 is short, and such that 
$\dfrac{10^k-1}{c\cdot m}$
 is not short for any 
$1\le k < t$
.
 Let 
$S(m)$
 be the the set of 
$m-$
t
astic numbers. Consider 
$S(m)$
 for 
$m=1,2,\ldots{}.$
 What is the maximum number of elements in 
$S(m)$
?
