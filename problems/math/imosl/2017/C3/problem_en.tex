Sir Alex plays the following game on a row of 9 cells. Initially, all cells are empty. In each move, Sir Alex is allowed to perform exactly one of the following two operations:


Choose any number of the form 
$2^j$,
 where 
$j$
 is a non-negative integer, and put it into an empty cell.
Choose two (not necessarily adjacent) cells with the same number in them; denote that number by 
$2^j$.
 Replace the number in one of the cells with 
$2^{j+1}$
 and erase the number in the other cell.


At the end of the game, one cell contains 
$2^n$,
 where 
$n$
 is a given positive integer, while the other cells are empty. Determine the maximum number of moves that Sir Alex could have made, in terms of 
$n$.
