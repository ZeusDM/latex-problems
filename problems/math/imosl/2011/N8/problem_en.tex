Let 
$k \in \mathbb{Z}^+$
 and set 
$n=2^k+1.$
 Prove that 
$n$
 is a prime number if and only if the following holds: there is a permutation 
$a_{1},\ldots,a_{n-1}$
 of the numbers 
$1,2, \ldots, n-1$
 and a sequence of integers 
$g_{1},\ldots,g_{n-1},$
 such that 
$n$
 divides 
$g^{a_i}_i - a_{i+1}$
 for every 
$i \in \{1,2,\ldots,n-1\},$
 where we set 
$a_n = a_1.$
