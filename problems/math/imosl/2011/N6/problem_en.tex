Let 
$P(x)$
 and 
$Q(x)$
 be two polynomials with integer coefficients, such that no nonconstant polynomial with rational coefficients divides both 
$P(x)$
 and 
$Q(x).$
 Suppose that for every positive integer 
$n$
 the integers 
$P(n)$
 and 
$Q(n)$
 are positive, and 
$2^{Q(n)}-1$
 divides 
$3^{P(n)}-1.$
 Prove that 
$Q(x)$
 is a constant polynomial.
