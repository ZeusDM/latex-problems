Let 
$ABCDEF$
 be a convex hexagon all of whose sides are tangent to a circle 
$\omega$
 with centre 
$O$.
 Suppose that the circumcircle of triangle 
$ACE$
 is concentric with 
$\omega$.
 Let 
$J$
 be the foot of the perpendicular from 
$B$
 to 
$CD$.
 Suppose that the perpendicular from 
$B$
 to 
$DF$
 intersects the line 
$EO$
 at a point 
$K$.
 Let 
$L$
 be the foot of the perpendicular from 
$K$
 to 
$DE$.
 Prove that 
$DJ=DL$.
