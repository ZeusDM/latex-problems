Let 
$ABC$
 be an acute triangle with circumcircle 
$\Omega$.
 Let 
$B_0$
 be the midpoint of 
$AC$
 and let 
$C_0$
 be the midpoint of 
$AB$.
 Let 
$D$
 be the foot of the altitude from 
$A$
 and let 
$G$
 be the centroid of the triangle 
$ABC$.
 Let 
$\omega$
 be a circle through 
$B_0$
 and 
$C_0$
 that is tangent to the circle 
$\Omega$
 at a point 
$X\not= A$.
 Prove that the points 
$D,G$
 and 
$X$
 are collinear.
