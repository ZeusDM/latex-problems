Let 
$ABC$
 be a triangle with incentre 
$I$
 and circumcircle 
$\omega$.
 Let 
$D$
 and 
$E$
 be the second intersection points of 
$\omega$
 with 
$AI$
 and 
$BI$, 
 respectively. The chord 
$DE$
 meets 
$AC$
 at a point 
$F$, 
 and 
$BC$
 at a point 
$G$.
 Let 
$P$
 be the intersection point of the line through 
$F$
 parallel to 
$AD$
 and the line through 
$G$
 parallel to 
$BE$.
 Suppose that the tangents to 
$\omega$
 at 
$A$
 and 
$B$
 meet at a point 
$K$.
 Prove that the three lines 
$AE,BD$
 and 
$KP$
 are either parallel or concurrent.
