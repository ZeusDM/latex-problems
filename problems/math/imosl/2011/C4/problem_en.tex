Determine the greatest positive integer 
$k$
 that satisfies the following property: The set of positive integers can be partitioned into 
$k$
 subsets 
$A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k$
 such that for all integers 
$n \geq 15$
 and all 
$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$
 there exist two distinct elements of 
$A_i$
 whose sum is 
$n.$
