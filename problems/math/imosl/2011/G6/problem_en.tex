Let 
$ABC$
 be a triangle with 
$AB=AC$
 and let 
$D$
 be the midpoint of 
$AC$.
 The angle bisector of 
$\angle BAC$
 intersects the circle through 
$D,B$
  and 
$C$
 at the point 
$E$
  inside the triangle 
$ABC$.
 The line 
$BD$
 intersects the circle through 
$A,E$
 and 
$B$
 in two points 
$B$
 and 
$F$.
 The lines 
$AF$
 and 
$BE$
 meet at a point 
$I$, 
 and the lines 
$CI$
 and 
$BD$
 meet at a point 
$K$.
 Show that 
$I$
 is the incentre of triangle 
$KAB$.
