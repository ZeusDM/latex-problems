Let 
$ABC$
 be an acute triangle with circumcircle 
$\Gamma$.
 Let 
$\ell$
 be a tangent line to 
$\Gamma$, 
 and let 
$\ell_a, \ell_b$
 and 
$\ell_c$
 be the lines obtained by reflecting 
$\ell$
 in the lines 
$BC$, 
 
$CA$
 and 
$AB$, 
 respectively. Show that the circumcircle of the triangle determined by the lines 
$\ell_a, \ell_b$
 and 
$\ell_c$
 is tangent to the circle 
$\Gamma$.
