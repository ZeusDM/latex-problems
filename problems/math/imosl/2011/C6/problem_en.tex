Let 
$n$
 be a positive integer, and let 
$W = \ldots x_{-1}x_0x_1x_2 \ldots$
 be an infinite periodic word, consisting of just letters 
$a$
 and/or 
$b$.
 Suppose that the minimal period 
$N$
 of 
$W$
 is greater than 
$2^n$.


A finite nonempty word 
$U$
 is said to 
appear
 in 
$W$
 if there exist indices 
$k \leq \ell$
 such that 
$U=x_k x_{k+1} \ldots x_{\ell}$.
 A finite word 
$U$
 is called 
ubiquitous
 if the four words 
$Ua$, 
$Ub$, 
$aU$, 
 and 
$bU$
 all appear in 
$W$.
 Prove that there are at least 
$n$
 ubiquitous finite nonempty words.
