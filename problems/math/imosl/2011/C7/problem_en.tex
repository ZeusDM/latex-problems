On a square table of 
$2011$
 by 
$2011$
 cells we place a finite number of napkins that each cover a square of 
$52$
 by 
$52$
 cells. In each cell we write the number of napkins covering it, and we record the maximal number 
$k$
 of cells that all contain the same nonzero number. Considering all possible napkin configurations, what is the largest value of 
$k$?
