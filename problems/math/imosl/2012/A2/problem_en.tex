Let $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ be the sets of integers and rationals respectively.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item Does there exist a partition of $\mathbb{Z}$ into three non-empty subsets $A,B,C$ such that the sets $A+B, B+C, C+A$ are disjoint?
	\item Does there exist a partition of $\mathbb{Q}$ into three non-empty subsets $A,B,C$ such that the sets $A+B, B+C, C+A$ are disjoint?
\end{enumerate}

Here, $X+Y$ denotes the set $\{ x+y : x \in X, y \in Y \}$, for $X,Y \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ and for $X,Y \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$.
