We say that a function 
$f:\mathbb{R}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
 is a metapolynomial if, for some positive integers 
$m$
 and 
$n$, 
 it can be represented in the form
\[f(x_1,\cdots , x_k )=\max_{i=1,\cdots , m} \min_{j=1,\cdots , n}P_{i,j}(x_1,\cdots , x_k),\]


where 
$P_{i,j}$
 are multivariate polynomials. Prove that the product of two metapolynomials is also a metapolynomial.
