In a 
$999 \times 999$
 square table some cells are white and the remaining ones are red. Let 
$T$
 be the number of triples 
$(C_1,C_2,C_3)$
 of cells, the first two in the same row and the last two in the same column, with 
$C_1,C_3$
 white and 
$C_2$
 red. Find the maximum value 
$T$
 can attain.
