Let 
$ABCD$
 be a convex quadrilateral with non-parallel sides 
$BC$
 and 
$AD$.
 Assume that there is a point 
$E$
 on the side 
$BC$
 such that the quadrilaterals 
$ABED$
 and 
$AECD$
 are circumscribed.
 
 Prove that there is a point 
$F$
 on the side 
$AD$
 such that the quadrilaterals 
$ABCF$
 and 
$BCDF$
 are circumscribed if and only if 
$AB$
 is parallel to 
$CD$.
