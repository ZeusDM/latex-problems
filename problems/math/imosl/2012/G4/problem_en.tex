Let 
$ABC$
 be a triangle with 
$AB \neq AC$
 and circumcenter 
$O$.
 The bisector of 
$\angle BAC$
 intersects 
$BC$
 at 
$D$.
 Let 
$E$
 be the reflection of 
$D$
 with respect to the midpoint of 
$BC$.
 The lines through 
$D$
 and 
$E$
 perpendicular to 
$BC$
 intersect the lines 
$AO$
 and 
$AD$
 at 
$X$
 and 
$Y$
 respectively. Prove that the quadrilateral 
$BXCY$
 is cyclic.
