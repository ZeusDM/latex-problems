Given triangle 
$ABC$
 the point 
$J$
 is the centre of the excircle opposite the vertex 
$A.$
 This excircle is tangent to the side 
$BC$
 at 
$M$, 
 and to the lines 
$AB$
 and 
$AC$
 at 
$K$
 and 
$L$, 
 respectively. The lines 
$LM$
 and 
$BJ$
 meet at 
$F$, 
 and the lines 
$KM$
 and 
$CJ$
 meet at 
$G.$
 Let 
$S$
 be the point of intersection of the lines 
$AF$
 and 
$BC$, 
 and let 
$T$
 be the point of intersection of the lines 
$AG$
 and 
$BC.$
 Prove that 
$M$
 is the midpoint of 
$ST.$
