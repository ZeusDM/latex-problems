Let 
$ABCD$
 be a cyclic quadrilateral whose diagonals 
$AC$
 and 
$BD$
 meet at 
$E$.
 The extensions of the sides 
$AD$
 and 
$BC$
 beyond 
$A$
 and 
$B$
 meet at 
$F$.
 Let 
$G$
 be the point such that 
$ECGD$
 is a parallelogram, and let 
$H$
 be the image of 
$E$
 under reflection in 
$AD$.
 Prove that 
$D,H,F,G$
 are concyclic.
