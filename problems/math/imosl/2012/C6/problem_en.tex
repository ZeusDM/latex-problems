The liar's guessing game is a game played between two players $A$ and $B$.
The rules of the game depend on two positive integers $k$ and $n$ which are known to both players.

At the start of the game $A$ chooses integers $x$ and $N$ with $1 \le x \le N.$
Player $A$ keeps $x$ secret, and truthfully tells $N$ to player $B$.
Player $B$ now tries to obtain information about $x$ by asking player $A$ questions as follows:
each question consists of $B$ specifying an arbitrary set $S$ of positive integers (possibly one specified in some previous question), and asking $A$ whether $x$ belongs to $S$.
Player $B$ may ask as many questions as he wishes.
After each question, player $A$ must immediately answer it with yes or no, but is allowed to lie as many times as she wants;
the only restriction is that, among any $k+1$ consecutive answers, at least one answer must be truthful.

After $B$ has asked as many questions as he wants, he must specify a set $X$ of at most $n$ positive integers.
If $x$ belongs to $X$,  then $B$ wins; otherwise, he loses.
Prove that:

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item If $n \ge 2^k,$ then $B$ can guarantee a win.

	\item For all sufficiently large $k$,  there exists an integer $n \ge (1.99)^k$ such that $B$ cannot guarantee a win.
\end{enumerate}
