Call admissible a set 
$A$
 of integers that has the following property:


If 
$x,y \in A$
 (possibly 
$x=y$)
 then 
$x^2+kxy+y^2 \in A$
 for every integer 
$k$.


Determine all pairs 
$m,n$
 of nonzero integers such that the only admissible set containing both 
$m$
 and 
$n$
 is the set of all integers.
