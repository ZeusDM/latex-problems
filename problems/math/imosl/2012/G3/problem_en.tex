In an acute triangle 
$ABC$
 the points 
$D,E$
 and 
$F$
 are the feet of the altitudes through 
$A,B$
 and 
$C$
 respectively. The incenters of the triangles 
$AEF$
 and 
$BDF$
 are 
$I_1$
 and 
$I_2$
 respectively; the circumcenters of the triangles 
$ACI_1$
 and 
$BCI_2$
 are 
$O_1$
 and 
$O_2$
 respectively. Prove that 
$I_1I_2$
 and 
$O_1O_2$
 are parallel.
