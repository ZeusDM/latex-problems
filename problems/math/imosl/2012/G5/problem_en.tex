Let 
$ABC$
 be a triangle with 
$\angle BCA=90^{\circ}$, 
 and let 
$D$
 be the foot of the altitude from 
$C$.
 Let 
$X$
 be a point in the interior of the segment 
$CD$.
 Let 
$K$
 be the point on the segment 
$AX$
 such that 
$BK=BC$.
 Similarly, let 
$L$
 be the point on the segment 
$BX$
 such that 
$AL=AC$.
 Let 
$M$
 be the point of intersection of 
$AL$
 and 
$BK$.


Show that 
$MK=ML$.
