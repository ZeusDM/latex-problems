Let 
$ABC$
 be a triangle with circumcircle 
$\omega$
 and 
$\ell$
 a line without common points with 
$\omega$.
 Denote by 
$P$
 the foot of the perpendicular from the center of 
$\omega$
 to 
$\ell$.
 The side-lines 
$BC,CA,AB$
 intersect 
$\ell$
 at the points 
$X,Y,Z$
 different from 
$P$.

Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles 
$AXP$, 
$BYP$
 and 
$CZP$
 have a common point different from 
$P$
 or are mutually tangent at 
$P$.
