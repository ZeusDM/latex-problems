\playerA{Players $A$} and \playerB{$B$} play a game with $N \geq 2012$ coins and $2012$ boxes arranged around a circle.
Initially \playerA{$A$} distributes the coins among the boxes so that there is at least $1$ coin in each box.
Then the two of them make moves in the order \playerB{$B$}, \playerA{$A$}, \playerB{$B$}, \playerA{$A$}, $\ldots$ by the following rules:

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item On every of their moves, \playerB{$B$} passes $1$ coin from every box to an adjacent box.
 
	\item On every of their moves, \playerA{$A$} chooses several coins that were not involved in \playerB{$B$}'s previous move and are in different boxes.
		She passes every coin to and adjacent box.
\end{enumerate}

\playerA{Player $A$}'s goal is to ensure at least $1$ coin in each box after every move of them, regardless of how \playerB{$B$} plays and how many moves are made.
Find the least $N$ that enables \playerA{$A$} to succeed.
