Let 
$r$
 be a positive integer, and let 
$a_0 , a_1 , \cdots $
 be an infinite sequence of real numbers. Assume that for all nonnegative integers 
$m$
 and 
$s$
 there exists a positive integer 
$n \in [m+1, m+r]$
 such that
\[ a_m + a_{m+1} +\cdots +a_{m+s} = a_n + a_{n+1} +\cdots +a_{n+s} \]


Prove that the sequence is periodic, i.e. there exists some 
$p \ge 1 $
 such that 
$a_{n+p} =a_n $
 for all 
$n \ge 0$.
