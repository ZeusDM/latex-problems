Players 
$A$
 and 
$B$
 play a "paintful" game on the real line. Player 
$A$
 has a pot of paint with four units of black ink. A quantity 
$p$
 of this ink suffices to blacken a (closed) real interval of length 
$p$.
 In every round, player 
$A$
 picks some positive integer 
$m$
 and provides 
$1/2^m $
 units of ink from the pot. Player 
$B$
 then picks an integer 
$k$
 and blackens the interval from 
$k/2^m$
 to 
$(k+1)/2^m$
 (some parts of this interval may have been blackened before). The goal of player 
$A$
 is to reach a situation where the pot is empty and the interval 
$[0,1]$
 is not completely blackened.


Decide whether there exists a strategy for player 
$A$
 to win in a finite number of moves.
