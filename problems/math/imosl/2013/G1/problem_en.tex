Let 
$ABC$
 be an acute triangle with orthocenter 
$H$, 
 and let 
$W$
 be a point on the side 
$BC$, 
 lying strictly between 
$B$
 and 
$C$.
 The points 
$M$
 and 
$N$
 are the feet of the altitudes from 
$B$
 and 
$C$, 
 respectively. Denote by 
$\omega_1$
 is the circumcircle of 
$BWN$, 
 and let 
$X$
 be the point on 
$\omega_1$
 such that 
$WX$
 is a diameter of 
$\omega_1$.
 Analogously, denote by 
$\omega_2$
 the circumcircle of triangle 
$CWM$, 
 and let 
$Y$
 be the point such that 
$WY$
 is a diameter of 
$\omega_2$.
 Prove that 
$X,Y$
 and 
$H$
 are collinear.
