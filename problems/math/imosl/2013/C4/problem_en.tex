Let 
$n$
 be a positive integer, and let 
$A$
 be a subset of 
$\{ 1,\cdots ,n\}$.
 An 
$A$-partition of 
$n$
 into 
$k$
 parts is a representation of n as a sum 
$n = a_1 + \cdots + a_k$, 
 where the parts 
$a_1 , \cdots , a_k $
 belong to 
$A$
 and are not necessarily distinct. The number of different parts in such a partition is the number of (distinct) elements in the set 
$\{ a_1 , a_2 , \cdots , a_k \} $.


We say that an 
$A$-partition of 
$n$
 into 
$k$
 parts is optimal if there is no 
$A$-partition of 
$n$
 into 
$r$
 parts with 
$r<k$.
 Prove that any optimal 
$A$-partition of 
$n$
 contains at most 
$\sqrt[3]{6n}$
 different parts.
