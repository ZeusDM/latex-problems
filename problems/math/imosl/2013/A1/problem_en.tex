Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$ be arbitrary real numbers.
Define the sequences $u_0, \ldots, u_n$ and $v_0, \ldots, v_n$ inductively by $u_0 = u_1  = v_0 = v_1 = 1$, and $u_{k+1} = u_k + a_k u_{k-1}$, $v_{k+1} = v_k + a_{n-k} v_{k-1}$ for $k=1, \ldots, n-1$.

Prove that $u_n = v_n.$
