Let 
$n \ge 3$
 be an integer, and consider a circle with 
$n + 1$
 equally spaced points marked on it. Consider all labellings of these points with the numbers 
$0, 1, ... , n$
 such that each label is used exactly once; two such labellings are considered to be the same if one can be obtained from the other by a rotation of the circle. A labelling is called 
beautiful
 if, for any four labels 
$a < b < c < d$
 with 
$a + d = b + c$, 
 the chord joining the points labelled 
$a$
 and 
$d$
 does not intersect the chord joining the points labelled 
$b$
 and 
$c$.


Let 
$M$
 be the number of beautiful labelings, and let N be the number of ordered pairs 
$(x, y)$
 of positive integers such that 
$x + y \le n$
 and 
$\gcd(x, y) = 1$.
 Prove that 
$$M = N + 1.$$
