In a triangle 
$ABC$, 
 let 
$D$
 and 
$E$
 be the feet of the angle bisectors of angles 
$A$
 and 
$B$, 
 respectively. A rhombus is inscribed into the quadrilateral 
$AEDB$
 (all vertices of the rhombus lie on different sides of 
$AEDB$)
. Let 
$\varphi$
 be the non-obtuse angle of the rhombus. Prove that 
$\varphi \le \max \{  \angle BAC, \angle ABC  \}$.
