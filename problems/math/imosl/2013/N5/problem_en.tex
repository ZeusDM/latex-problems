Fix an integer 
$k>2$.
 Two players, called Ana and Banana, play the following game of numbers. Initially, some integer 
$n \ge k$
 gets written on the blackboard. Then they take moves in turn, with Ana beginning. A player making a move erases the number 
$m$
 just written on the blackboard and replaces it by some number 
$m'$
 with 
$k \le m' < m$
 that is coprime to 
$m$.
 The first player who cannot move anymore loses.


An integer 
$n \ge k $
is called \emph{good} if Banana has a winning strategy when the initial number is 
$n$, 
and \emph{bad} otherwise.


Consider two integers 
$n,n' \ge k$
 with the property that each prime number 
$p \le k$
 divides 
$n$
 if and only if it divides 
$n'$.
 Prove that either both 
$n$
 and 
$n'$
 are good or both are bad.
