Let 
$\nu$
 be an irrational positive number, and let 
$m$
 be a positive integer. A pair of 
$(a,b)$
 of positive integers is called 
good
 if
\[a \left \lceil b\nu \right \rceil - b \left \lfloor a \nu \right \rfloor = m.\]
 A good pair 
$(a,b)$
 is called 
excellent
 if neither of the pair 
$(a-b,b)$
 and 
$(a,b-a)$
 is good.


Prove that the number of excellent pairs is equal to the sum of the positive divisors of 
$m$.
