Let 
$ABC$
 be a triangle with 
$\angle B > \angle C$.
 Let 
$P$
 and 
$Q$
 be two different points on line 
$AC$
 such that 
$\angle PBA = \angle QBA = \angle ACB $
 and 
$A$
 is located between 
$P$
 and 
$C$.
 Suppose that there exists an interior point 
$D$
 of segment 
$BQ$
 for which 
$PD=PB$.
 Let the ray 
$AD$
 intersect the circle 
$ABC$
 at 
$R \neq A$.
 Prove that 
$QB = QR$.
