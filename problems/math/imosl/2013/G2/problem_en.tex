Let 
$\omega$
 be the circumcircle of a triangle 
$ABC$.
 Denote by 
$M$
 and 
$N$
 the midpoints of the sides 
$AB$
 and 
$AC$, 
 respectively, and denote by 
$T$
 the midpoint of the arc 
$BC$
 of 
$\omega$
 not containing 
$A$.
 The circumcircles of the triangles 
$AMT$
 and 
$ANT$
 intersect the perpendicular bisectors of 
$AC$
 and 
$AB$
 at points 
$X$
 and 
$Y$, 
 respectively; assume that 
$X$
 and 
$Y$
 lie inside the triangle 
$ABC$.
 The lines 
$MN$
 and 
$XY$
 intersect at 
$K$.
 Prove that 
$KA=KT$.
