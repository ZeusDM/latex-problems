Let 
$n$
 be a positive integer. Determine the smallest positive integer 
$k$
 with the following property: it is possible to mark 
$k$
 cells on a 
$2n \times 2n$
 board so that there exists a unique partition of the board into 
$1 \times 2$
 and 
$2 \times 1$
 dominoes, none of which contain two marked cells.
