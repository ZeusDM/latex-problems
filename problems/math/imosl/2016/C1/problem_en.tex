The leader of an IMO team chooses positive integers 
$n$
 and 
$k$
 with 
$n > k$, 
 and announces them to the deputy leader and a contestant. The leader then secretly tells the deputy leader an 
$n$-digit binary string, and the deputy leader writes down all 
$n$-digit binary strings which differ from the leader’s in exactly 
$k$
 positions. (For example, if 
$n = 3$
 and 
$k = 1$, 
 and if the leader chooses 
$101$, 
 the deputy leader would write down 
$001, 111$
 and 
$100$.)
The contestant is allowed to look at the strings written by the deputy leader and guess the leader’s string. What is the minimum number of guesses (in terms of 
$n$
 and 
$k$)
 needed to guarantee the correct answer?
