There are 
$n \geq 3$
 islands in a city. Initially, the ferry company offers some routes between some pairs of islands so that it is impossible to divide the islands into two groups such that no two islands in different groups are connected by a ferry route.


After each year, the ferry company will close a ferry route between some two islands 
$X$
 and 
$Y$. 
 At the same time, in order to maintain its service, the company will open new routes according to the following rule: for any island which is connected to a ferry route to exactly one of 
$X$
 and 
$Y$, 
 a new route between this island and the other of 
$X$
 and 
$Y$
 is added.


Suppose at any moment, if we partition all islands into two nonempty groups in any way, then it is known that the ferry company will close a certain route connecting two islands from the two groups after some years. Prove that after some years there will be an island which is connected to all other islands by ferry routes.
