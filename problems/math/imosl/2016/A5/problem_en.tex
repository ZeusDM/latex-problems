Consider fractions 
$\frac{a}{b}$
 where 
$a$
 and 
$b$
 are positive integers.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] Prove that for every positive integer 
	$n$, 
	 there exists such a fraction 
	$\frac{a}{b}$
	 such that 
	$\sqrt{n} \le \frac{a}{b} \le \sqrt{n+1}$
	 and 
	$b \le \sqrt{n}+1$. 


	\item[(b)] Show that there are infinitely many positive integers 
	$n$
	 such that no such fraction 
	$\frac{a}{b}$
	 satisfies 
	$\sqrt{n} \le \frac{a}{b} \le \sqrt{n+1}$
	 and 
	$b \le \sqrt{n}$. 
\end{itemize}
