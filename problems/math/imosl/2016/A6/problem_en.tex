The equation
$$(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-2016)=(x-1)(x-2)\cdots (x-2016)$$
is written on the board, with 
$2016$
 linear factors on each side. What is the least possible value of 
$k$
 for which it is possible to erase exactly 
$k$
 of these 
$4032$
 linear factors so that at least one factor remains on each side and the resulting equation has no real solutions?
