Let 
$ABCD$
 be a convex quadrilateral with 
$\angle ABC = \angle ADC < 90^{\circ}$. 
 The internal angle bisectors of 
$\angle ABC$
 and 
$\angle ADC$
 meet 
$AC$
 at 
$E$
 and 
$F$
 respectively, and meet each other at point 
$P$. 
 Let 
$M$
 be the midpoint of 
$AC$
 and let 
$\omega$
 be the circumcircle of triangle 
$BPD$. 
 Segments 
$BM$
 and 
$DM$
 intersect 
$\omega$
 again at 
$X$
 and 
$Y$
 respectively. Denote by 
$Q$
 the intersection point of lines 
$XE$
 and 
$YF$. 
 Prove that 
$PQ \perp AC$.
