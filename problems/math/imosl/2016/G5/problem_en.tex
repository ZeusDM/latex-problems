Let 
$D$
 be the foot of perpendicular from 
$A$
 to the Euler line (the line passing through the circumcentre and the orthocentre) of an acute scalene triangle 
$ABC$. 
 A circle 
$\omega$
 with centre 
$S$
 passes through 
$A$
 and 
$D$, 
 and it intersects sides 
$AB$
 and 
$AC$
 at 
$X$
 and 
$Y$
 respectively. Let 
$P$
 be the foot of altitude from 
$A$
 to 
$BC$, 
 and let 
$M$
 be the midpoint of 
$BC$. 
 Prove that the circumcentre of triangle 
$XSY$
 is equidistant from 
$P$
 and 
$M$.
