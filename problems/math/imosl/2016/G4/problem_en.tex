Let 
$ABC$
 be a triangle with 
$AB = AC \neq BC$
 and let 
$I$
 be its incentre. The line 
$BI$
 meets 
$AC$
 at 
$D$, 
 and the line through 
$D$
 perpendicular to 
$AC$
 meets 
$AI$
 at 
$E$. 
 Prove that the reflection of 
$I$
 in 
$AC$
 lies on the circumcircle of triangle 
$BDE$.
