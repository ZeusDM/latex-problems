Let 
$a$
 be a positive integer which is not a perfect square, and consider the equation 
\[k = \frac{x^2-a}{x^2-y^2}.\]
Let 
$A$
 be the set of positive integers 
$k$
 for which the equation admits a solution in 
$\mathbb Z^2$
 with 
$x>\sqrt{a}$, 
 and let 
$B$
 be the set of positive integers for which the equation admits a solution in 
$\mathbb Z^2$
 with 
$0\leq x<\sqrt{a}$. 
 Show that 
$A=B$.
