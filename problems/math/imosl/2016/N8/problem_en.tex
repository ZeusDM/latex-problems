Find all polynomials 
$P(x)$
 of odd degree 
$d$
 and with integer coefficients satisfying the following property: for each positive integer 
$n$, 
 there exists 
$n$
 positive integers 
$x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$
 such that 
$\frac12 < \frac{P(x_i)}{P(x_j)} < 2$
 and 
$\frac{P(x_i)}{P(x_j)}$
 is the 
$d$-th power of a rational number for every pair of indices 
$i$
 and 
$j$
 with 
$1 \leq i, j \leq n$.
