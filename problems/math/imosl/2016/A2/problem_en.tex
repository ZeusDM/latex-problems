Find the smallest constant 
$C > 0$
 for which the following statement holds: among any five positive real numbers 
$a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5$
 (not necessarily distinct), one can always choose distinct subscripts 
$i,j,k,l$
 such that
\[ \left| \frac{a_i}{a_j} - \frac {a_k}{a_l} \right| \le C. \]
