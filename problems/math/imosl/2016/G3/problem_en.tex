Let 
$B = (-1, 0)$
 and 
$C = (1, 0)$
 be fixed points on the coordinate plane. A nonempty, bounded subset 
$S$
 of the plane is said to be 
nice
 if:
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(i)] there is a point 
    $T$
     in 
    $S$
     such that for every point 
    $Q$
     in 
    $S$, 
     the segment 
    $TQ$
     lies entirely in 
    $S$;
    
    \item[(ii)]  for any triangle 
    $P_1P_2P_3$, 
     there exists a unique point 
    $A$
     in 
    $S$
     and a permutation 
    $\sigma$
     of the indices 
    $\{1, 2, 3\}$
     for which triangles 
    $ABC$
     and 
    $P_{\sigma(1)}P_{\sigma(2)}P_{\sigma(3)}$
     are similar.
\end{itemize}

Prove that there exist two distinct nice subsets 
$S$
 and 
$S'$
 of the set 
$\{(x, y) : x \geq 0, y \geq 0\}$
 such that if 
$A \in S$
 and 
$A' \in S'$
 are the unique choices of points in 
$\text{(ii)}$, 
 then the product 
$BA \cdot BA'$
 is a constant independent of the triangle 
$P_1P_2P_3$.
