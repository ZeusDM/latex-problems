Triangle 
$BCF$
 has a right angle at 
$B$. 
 Let 
$A$
 be the point on line 
$CF$
 such that 
$FA=FB$
 and 
$F$
 lies between 
$A$
 and 
$C$. 
 Point 
$D$
 is chosen so that 
$DA=DC$
 and 
$AC$
 is the bisector of 
$\angle{DAB}$. 
 Point 
$E$
 is chosen so that 
$EA=ED$
 and 
$AD$
 is the bisector of 
$\angle{EAC}$. 
 Let 
$M$
 be the midpoint of 
$CF$. 
 Let 
$X$
 be the point such that 
$AMXE$
 is a parallelogram. Prove that 
$BD,FX$
 and 
$ME$
 are concurrent.
