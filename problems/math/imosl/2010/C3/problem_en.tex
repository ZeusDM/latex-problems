2500 chess kings have to be placed on a $100 \times 100$ chessboard so that(i) no king can capture any other one (i.e. no two kings are placed in two squares sharing a common vertex);(ii) each row and each column contains exactly 25 kings.

Find the number of such arrangements. (Two arrangements differing by rotation or symmetry are supposed to be different.)
