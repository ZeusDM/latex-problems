Let $n$ be a positive integer. Each point $\left(x,y\right)$ in the plane, where $x$ and $y$ are non-negative integers with $x+y<n$, is coloured red or blue, subject to the following condition: if a point $\left(x,y\right)$ is red, then so are all points $\left(x',y'\right)$ with $x'\leq x$ and $y'\leq y$. Let $A$ be the number of way to choose $n$ blue points with distinct $x$-coordinates, and let $B$ be the number of ways to choose $n$ blue points with distinct $y$-coordinates. Prove that $A=B$.
