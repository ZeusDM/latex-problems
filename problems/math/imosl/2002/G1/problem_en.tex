Let $B$ be a point on a circle $S_1$, and let $A$ be a point distinct from $B$ on the tangent at $B$ to $S_1$. Let $C$ be a point not on $S_1$ such that the line segment $AC$ meets $S_1$ at two distinct points. Let $S_2$ be the circle touching $AC$ at $C$ and touching $S_1$ at a point $D$ on the opposite side of $AC$ from $B$. Prove that the circumcentre of triangle $BCD$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$.
