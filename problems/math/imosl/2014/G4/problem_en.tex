Consider a fixed circle 
$\Gamma$
 with three fixed points 
$A, B,$
 and 
$C$
 on it. Also, let us fix a real number 
$\lambda \in(0,1)$.
 For a variable point 
$P \not\in\{A, B, C\}$
 on 
$\Gamma$, 
 let 
$M$
 be the point on the segment 
$CP$
 such that 
$CM =\lambda\cdot  CP$
 . Let 
$Q$
 be the second point of intersection of the circumcircles of the triangles 
$AMP$
 and 
$BMC$.
 Prove that as 
$P$
 varies, the point 
$Q$
 lies on a fixed circle.
