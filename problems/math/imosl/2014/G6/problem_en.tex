Let 
$ABC$
 be a fixed acute-angled triangle. Consider some points 
$E$
 and 
$F$
 lying on the sides 
$AC$
 and 
$AB$, 
 respectively, and let 
$M$
 be the midpoint of 
$EF$
 . Let the perpendicular bisector of 
$EF$
 intersect the line 
$BC$
 at 
$K$, 
 and let the perpendicular bisector of 
$MK$
 intersect the lines 
$AC$
 and 
$AB$
 at 
$S$
 and 
$T$
 , respectively. We call the pair 
$(E, F )$
$\textit{interesting}$, 
 if the quadrilateral 
$KSAT$
 is cyclic.


Suppose that the pairs 
$(E_1, F_1)$
 and 
$(E_2, F_2)$
 are interesting. Prove that 
$\displaystyle\frac{E_1 E_2}{AB}=\frac{F_1 F_2}{AC}$.
