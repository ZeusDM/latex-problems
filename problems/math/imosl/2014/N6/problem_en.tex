Let 
$a_1 < a_2 <  \cdots <a_n$
 be pairwise coprime positive integers with 
$a_1$
 being prime and 
$a_1 \ge n + 2$.
 On the segment 
$I = [0, a_1 a_2  \cdots a_n ]$
 of the real line, mark all integers that are divisible by at least one of the numbers 
$a_1 ,   \ldots , a_n$
 . These points split 
$I$
 into a number of smaller segments. Prove that the sum of the squares of the lengths of these segments is divisible by 
$a_1$.
