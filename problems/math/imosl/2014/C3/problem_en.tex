Let 
$n \ge 2$
 be an integer. Consider an 
$n \times n$
 chessboard consisting of 
$n^2$
 unit squares. A configuration of 
$n$
 rooks on this board is 
peaceful
 if every row and every column contains exactly one rook. Find the greatest positive integer 
$k$
 such that, for each peaceful configuration of 
$n$
 rooks, there is a 
$k \times k$
 square which does not contain a rook on any of its 
$k^2$
 unit squares.
