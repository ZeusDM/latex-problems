Let 
$P$
 and 
$Q$
 be on segment 
$BC$
 of an acute triangle 
$ABC$
 such that 
$\angle PAB=\angle BCA$
 and 
$\angle CAQ=\angle ABC$.
 Let 
$M$
 and 
$N$
 be the points on 
$AP$
 and 
$AQ$, 
 respectively, such that 
$P$
 is the midpoint of 
$AM$
 and 
$Q$
 is the midpoint of 
$AN$.
 Prove that the intersection of 
$BM$
 and 
$CN$
 is on the circumference of triangle 
$ABC$.
