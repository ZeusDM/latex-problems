Convex quadrilateral 
$ABCD$
 has 
$\angle ABC = \angle CDA = 90^{\circ}$.
 Point 
$H$
 is the foot of the perpendicular from 
$A$
 to 
$BD$.
 Points 
$S$
 and 
$T$
 lie on sides 
$AB$
 and 
$AD$, 
 respectively, such that 
$H$
 lies inside triangle 
$SCT$
 and 
\[
\angle CHS - \angle CSB = 90^{\circ}, \quad \angle THC - \angle DTC = 90^{\circ}. \]
 Prove that line 
$BD$
 is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle 
$TSH$.
