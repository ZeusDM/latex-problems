We have 
$2^m$
 sheets of paper, with the number 
$1$
 written on each of them. We perform the following operation. In every step we choose two distinct sheets; if the numbers on the two sheets are 
$a$
 and 
$b$, 
 then we erase these numbers and write the number 
$a + b$
 on both sheets. Prove that after 
$m2^{m -1}$
 steps, the sum of the numbers on all the sheets is at least 
$4^m$.
