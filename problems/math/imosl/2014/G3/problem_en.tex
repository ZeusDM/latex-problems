Let 
$\Omega$
 and 
$O$
 be the circumcircle and the circumcentre of an acute-angled triangle 
$ABC$
 with 
$AB > BC$.
 The angle bisector of 
$\angle ABC$
 intersects 
$\Omega$
 at 
$M \ne B$.
 Let 
$\Gamma$
 be the circle with diameter 
$BM$.
 The angle bisectors of 
$\angle AOB$
 and 
$\angle BOC$
 intersect 
$\Gamma$
 at points 
$P$
 and 
$Q,$
 respectively. The point 
$R$
 is chosen on the line 
$P Q$
 so that 
$BR = MR$.
 Prove that 
$BR\parallel AC$.


(Here we always assume that an angle bisector is a ray.)
