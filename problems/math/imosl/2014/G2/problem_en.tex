Let 
$ABC$
 be a triangle. The points 
$K, L,$
 and 
$M$
 lie on the segments 
$BC, CA,$
 and 
$AB,$
 respectively, such that the lines 
$AK, BL,$
 and 
$CM$
 intersect in a common point. Prove that it is possible to choose two of the triangles 
$ALM, BMK,$
 and 
$CKL$
 whose inradii sum up to at least the inradius of the triangle 
$ABC$.
