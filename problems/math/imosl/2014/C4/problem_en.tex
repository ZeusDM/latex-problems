Construct a tetromino by attaching two 
$2 \times 1$
 dominoes along their longer sides such that the midpoint of the longer side of one domino is a corner of the other domino. This construction yields two kinds of tetrominoes with opposite orientations. Let us call them 
$S$- and 
$Z$-tetrominoes, respectively.


Assume that a lattice polygon 
$P$
 can be tiled with 
$S$-tetrominoes. Prove that no matter how we tile 
$P$
 using only 
$S$- and 
$Z$-tetrominoes, we always use an even number of 
$Z$-tetrominoes.
