For each positive integer 
$n$, 
 the Bank of Cape Town issues coins of denomination 
 $\frac{1}{n}$.
 Given a finite collection of such coins (of not necessarily different denominations) with total value at most most 
$99+\frac12$, 
 prove that it is possible to split this collection into 
$100$
 or fewer groups, such that each group has total value at most 
$1$.
