Let 
$M$
 be a set of 
$n \ge 4$
 points in the plane, no three of which are collinear. Initially these points are connected with 
$n$
 segments so that each point in 
$M$
 is the endpoint of exactly two segments. Then, at each step, one may choose two segments 
$AB$
 and 
$CD$
 sharing a common interior point and replace them by the segments 
$AC$
 and 
$BD$
 if none of them is present at this moment. Prove that it is impossible to perform 
$n^3 /4$
 or more such moves.
