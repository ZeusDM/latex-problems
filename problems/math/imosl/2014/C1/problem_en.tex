Let 
$n$
 points be given inside a rectangle 
$R$
 such that no two of them lie on a line parallel to one of the sides of 
$R$.
 The rectangle 
$R$
 is to be dissected into smaller rectangles with sides parallel to the sides of 
$R$
 in such a way that none of these rectangles contains any of the given points in its interior. Prove that we have to dissect 
$R$
 into at least 
$n + 1$
 smaller rectangles.
