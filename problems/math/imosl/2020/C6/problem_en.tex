There are $4n$ pebbles of weights $1, 2, 3, \dots, 4n.$ Each pebble is coloured in one of $n$ colours and there are four pebbles of each colour. Show that we can arrange the pebbles into two piles so that the following two conditions are both satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The total weights of both piles are the same.
	\item Each pile contains two pebbles of each colour.
\end{itemize}
