Let $ABC$ be an isosceles triangle with $BC=CA$, and let $D$ be a point inside side $AB$ such that $AD< DB$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be two points inside sides $BC$ and $CA$, respectively, such that $\angle DPB = \angle DQA = 90^{\circ}$. Let the perpendicular bisector of $PQ$ meet line segment $CQ$ at $E$, and let the circumcircles of triangles $ABC$ and $CPQ$ meet again at point $F$, different from $C$.
Suppose that $P$, $E$, $F$ are collinear. Prove that $\angle ACB = 90^{\circ}$.
