Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral. Points $K, L, M, N$ are chosen on $AB, BC, CD, DA$ such that $KLMN$ is a rhombus with $KL \parallel AC$ and $LM \parallel BD$. Let $\omega_A, \omega_B, \omega_C, \omega_D$ be the incircles of $\triangle ANK, \triangle BKL, \triangle CLM, \triangle DMN$.

Prove that the common internal tangents to $\omega_A$, and $\omega_C$ and the common internal tangents to $\omega_B$ and $\omega_D$ are concurrent.
