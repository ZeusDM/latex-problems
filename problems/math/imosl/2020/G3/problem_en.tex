Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with $\angle ABC>90$, $CDA>90$ and $\angle DAB=\angle BCD$. Denote by $E$ and $F$ the reflections of $A$ in lines $BC$ and $CD$, respectively. Suppose that the segments $AE$ and $AF$ meet the line $BD$ at $K$ and $L$, respectively. Prove that the circumcircles of triangles $BEK$ and $DFL$ are tangent to each other.
