Let $P$ be a point on the circumcircle of acute triangle $ABC$. Let $D,E,F$ be the reflections of $P$ in the $A$-midline, $B$-midline, and $C$-midline. Let $\omega$ be the circumcircle of the triangle formed by the perpendicular bisectors of $AD, BE, CF$.

Show that the circumcircles of $\triangle ADP, \triangle BEP, \triangle CFP,$ and $\omega$ share a common point.
