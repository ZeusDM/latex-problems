Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a set consisting of $n \ge 3$ positive integers, none of which is a sum of two other distinct members of $\mathcal{S}$. Prove that the elements of $\mathcal{S}$ may be ordered as $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ so that $a_i$ does not divide $a_{i - 1} + a_{i + 1}$ for all $i = 2, 3, \dots, n - 1$.
