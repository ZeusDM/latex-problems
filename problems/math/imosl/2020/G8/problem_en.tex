Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incenter $I$ and circumcircle $\Gamma$. Circles $\omega_{B}$ passing through $B$ and $\omega_{C}$ passing through $C$ are tangent at $I$. Let $\omega_{B}$ meet minor arc $AB$ of $\Gamma$ at $P$ and $AB$ at $M\neq B$, and let $\omega_{C}$ meet minor arc $AC$ of $\Gamma$ at $Q$ and $AC$ at $N\neq C$. Rays $PM$ and $QN$ meet at $X$. Let $Y$ be a point such that $YB$ is tangent to $\omega_{B}$ and $YC$ is tangent to $\omega_{C}$.

Show that $A,X,Y$ are collinear.
