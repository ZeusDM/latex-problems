For any odd prime $p$ and any integer $n,$ let $d_p (n) \in \{ 0,1, \dots, p-1 \}$ denote the remainder when $n$ is divided by $p.$ We say that $(a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots)$ is a \textit{p-sequence}, if $a_0$ is a positive integer coprime to $p,$ and $a_{n+1} =a_n + d_p (a_n)$ for $n \geqslant 0.$
(a) Do there exist infinitely many primes $p$ for which there exist $p$-sequences $(a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots)$ and $(b_0, b_1, b_2, \dots)$ such that $a_n >b_n$ for infinitely many $n,$ and $b_n > a_n$ for infinitely many $n?$
(b) Do there exist infinitely many primes $p$ for which there exist $p$-sequences $(a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots)$ and $(b_0, b_1, b_2, \dots)$ such that $a_0 <b_0,$ but $a_n >b_n$ for all $n \geqslant 1?$
