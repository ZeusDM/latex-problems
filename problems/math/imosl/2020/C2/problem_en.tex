In a regular 100-gon, 41 vertices are colored black and the remaining 59 vertices are colored white. Prove that there exist 24 convex quadrilaterals $Q_{1}, \ldots, Q_{24}$ whose corners are vertices of the 100-gon, so that
\begin{itemize}
	\item the quadrilaterals $Q_{1}, \ldots, Q_{24}$ are pairwise disjoint, and
	\item every quadrilateral $Q_{i}$ has three corners of one color and one corner of the other color.
\end{itemize}
