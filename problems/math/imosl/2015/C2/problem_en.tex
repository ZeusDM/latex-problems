We say that a finite set 
$\mathcal{S}$
of points in the plane is 
balanced
if, for any two different points 
$A$
and 
$B$
in 
$\mathcal{S}$, 
there is a point 
$C$
in 
$\mathcal{S}$
such that 
$AC=BC$.
We say that 
$\mathcal{S}$
is 
centre-free
if for any three different points 
$A$, 

$B$
and 
$C$
in 
$\mathcal{S}$, 
there is no points 
$P$
in 
$\mathcal{S}$
such that 
$PA=PB=PC$.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] Show that for all integers 
	$n\ge 3$, 
	there exists a balanced set consisting of 
	$n$
	points.


	\item[(b)] Determine all integers 
	$n\ge 3$
	for which there exists a balanced centre-free set consisting of 
	$n$
	points.
