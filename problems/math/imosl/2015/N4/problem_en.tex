Suppose that 
$a_0, a_1, \cdots $
 and 
$b_0, b_1, \cdots$
 are two sequences of positive integers such that 
$a_0, b_0 \ge 2$
 and 
\[ a_{n+1} = \gcd{(a_n, b_n)} + 1, \qquad b_{n+1} = \operatorname{lcm}{(a_n, b_n)} - 1. \]
Show that the sequence 
$a_n$
 is eventually periodic; in other words, there exist integers 
$N \ge 0$
 and 
$t > 0$
 such that 
$a_{n+t} = a_n$
 for all 
$n \ge N$.
