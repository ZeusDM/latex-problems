Let 
$n$
 be a fixed integer with 
$n \ge 2$.
 We say that two polynomials 
$P$
 and 
$Q$
 with real coefficients are 
block-similar
 if for each 
$i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$
 the sequences
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(2015i), P(2015i - 1), \ldots, P(2015i - 2014) & \text{and}\\
Q(2015i), Q(2015i - 1), \ldots, Q(2015i - 2014)
\end{eqnarray*}

are permutations of each other.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[(a)] Prove that there exist distinct block-similar polynomials of degree 
	$n + 1$.
	
	\item[(b)] Prove that there do not exist distinct block-similar polynomials of degree 
	$n$.

\end{itemize}
