Let 
$ABCD$
 be a convex quadrilateral, and let 
$P$, 
$Q$, 
$R$,
and 
$S$
 be points on the sides 
$AB$, 
$BC$, 
$CD$, 
 and 
$DA$, 
 respectively. Let the line segment 
$PR$
 and 
$QS$
 meet at 
$O$.
 Suppose that each of the quadrilaterals 
$APOS$, 
$BQOP$, 
$CROQ$, 
 and 
$DSOR$
 has an incircle. Prove that the lines 
$AC$, 
 
$PQ$, 
 and 
$RS$
 are either concurrent or parallel to each other.
