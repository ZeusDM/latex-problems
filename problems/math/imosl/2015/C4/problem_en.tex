Let 
$n$
 be a positive integer. Two players 
$A$
 and 
$B$
 play a game in which they take turns choosing positive integers 
$k \le n$.
 The rules of the game are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A player cannot choose a number that has been chosen by either player on any previous turn.
    \item A player cannot choose a number consecutive to any of those the player has already chosen on any previous turn.
    \item The game is a draw if all numbers have been chosen; otherwise the player who cannot choose a number anymore loses the game.
\end{itemize}

The player 
$A$
takes the first turn. Determine the outcome of the game, assuming that both players use optimal strategies.
