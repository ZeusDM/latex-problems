Let 
$ABC$
 be an acute triangle with orthocenter 
$H$.
 Let 
$G$
 be the point such that the quadrilateral 
$ABGH$
 is a parallelogram. Let 
$I$
 be the point on the line 
$GH$
 such that 
$AC$
 bisects 
$HI$.
 Suppose that the line 
$AC$
 intersects the circumcircle of the triangle 
$GCI$
 at 
$C$
 and 
$J$.
 Prove that 
$IJ = AH$.
