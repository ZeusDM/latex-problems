In a company of people some pairs are enemies. A group of people is called 
unsociable
 if the number of members in the group is odd and at least 
$3$, 
 and it is possible to arrange all its members around a round table so that every two neighbors are enemies. Given that there are at most 
$2015$
 unsociable groups, prove that it is possible to partition the company into 
$11$
 parts so that no two enemies are in the same part.
