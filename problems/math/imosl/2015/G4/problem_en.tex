Let 
$ABC$
 be an acute triangle and let 
$M$
 be the midpoint of 
$AC$.
 A circle 
$\omega$
 passing through 
$B$
 and 
$M$
 meets the sides 
$AB$
 and 
$BC$
 at points 
$P$
 and 
$Q$
 respectively. Let 
$T$
 be the point such that 
$BPTQ$
 is a parallelogram. Suppose that 
$T$
 lies on the circumcircle of 
$ABC$.
 Determine all possible values of 
$\frac{BT}{BM}$.
