Let 
$ABC$
 be a triangle with 
$CA \neq CB$.
 Let 
$D$, 
$F$, 
 and 
$G$
 be the midpoints of the sides 
$AB$,
$AC$, 
 and 
$BC$
 respectively. A circle 
$\Gamma$
 passing through 
$C$
 and tangent to 
$AB$
 at 
$D$
 meets the segments 
$AF$
 and 
$BG$
 at 
$H$
 and 
$I$, 
 respectively. The points 
$H'$
 and 
$I'$
 are symmetric to 
$H$
 and 
$I$
 about 
$F$
 and 
$G$, 
 respectively. The line 
$H'I'$
 meets 
$CD$
 and 
$FG$
 at 
$Q$
 and 
$M$, 
 respectively. The line 
$CM$
 meets 
$\Gamma$
 again at 
$P$.
 Prove that 
$CQ = QP$.
