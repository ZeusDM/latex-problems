A 
triangulation
 of a convex polygon 
$\Pi$
 is a partitioning of 
$\Pi$
 into triangles by diagonals having no common points other than the vertices of the polygon. We say that a triangulation is a 
Thaiangulation
 if all triangles in it have the same area.


Prove that any two different Thaiangulations of a convex polygon 
$\Pi$
 differ by exactly two triangles. (In other words, prove that it is possible to replace one pair of triangles in the first Thaiangulation with a different pair of triangles so as to obtain the second Thaiangulation.)
