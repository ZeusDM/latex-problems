In Lineland there are 
$n\geq1$
 towns, arranged along a road running from left to right. Each town has a 
left bulldozer
 (put to the left of the town and facing left) and a 
right bulldozer
 (put to the right of the town and facing right). The sizes of the 
$2n$
 bulldozers are distinct. Every time when a left and right bulldozer confront each other, the larger bulldozer pushes the smaller one off the road. On the other hand, bulldozers are quite unprotected at their rears; so, if a bulldozer reaches the rear-end of another one, the first one pushes the second one off the road, regardless of their sizes.

Let 
$A$
 and 
$B$
 be two towns, with 
$B$
 to the right of 
$A$.
 We say that town 
$A$
 can 
sweep
 town 
$B$
away
 if the right bulldozer of 
$A$
 can move over to 
$B$
 pushing off all bulldozers it meets. Similarly town 
$B$
 can sweep town 
$A$
 away if the left bulldozer of 
$B$
 can move over to 
$A$
 pushing off all bulldozers of all towns on its way.

Prove that there is exactly one town that cannot be swept away by any other one.
