Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle{C} = 90^{\circ}$, and let $H$ be the foot of the altitude from $C$.
A point $D$ is chosen inside the triangle $CBH$ so that $CH$ bisects $AD$.
Let $P$ be the intersection point of the lines $BD$ and $CH$.
Let $\omega$ be the semicircle with diameter $BD$ that meets the segment $CB$ at an interior point.
A line through $P$ is tangent to $\omega$ at $Q$.
Prove that the lines $CQ$ and $AD$ meet on $\omega$.
