Triangle 
$ABC$
 has circumcircle 
$\Omega$
 and circumcenter 
$O$.
 A circle 
$\Gamma$
 with center 
$A$
 intersects the segment 
$BC$
 at points 
$D$
 and 
$E$, 
 such that 
$B$, 
$D$, 
$E$, 
 and 
$C$
 are all different and lie on line 
$BC$
 in this order. Let 
$F$
 and 
$G$
 be the points of intersection of 
$\Gamma$
 and 
$\Omega$, 
 such that 
$A$, 
$F$, 
$B$, 
$C$, 
 and 
$G$
 lie on 
$\Omega$
 in this order. Let 
$K$
 be the second point of intersection of the circumcircle of triangle 
$BDF$
 and the segment 
$AB$.
 Let 
$L$
 be the second point of intersection of the circumcircle of triangle 
$CGE$
 and the segment 
$CA$.


Suppose that the lines 
$FK$
 and 
$GL$
 are different and intersect at the point 
$X$.
 Prove that 
$X$
 lies on the line 
$AO$.
