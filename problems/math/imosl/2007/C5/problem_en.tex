In the Cartesian coordinate plane define the strips $ S_n = \{(x,y)|n\le x < n + 1\}$,  $ n\in\mathbb{Z}$ and color each strip black or white. Prove that any rectangle which is not a square can be placed in the plane so that its vertices have the same color.IMO Shortlist 2007 Problem C5 as it appears in the official booklet:

In the Cartesian coordinate plane define the strips $ S_n = \{(x,y)|n\le x < n + 1\}$ for every integer $ n.$ Assume each strip $ S_n$ is colored either red or blue, and let $ a$ and $ b$ be two distinct positive integers. Prove that there exists a rectangle with side length $ a$ and $ b$ such that its vertices have the same color.
