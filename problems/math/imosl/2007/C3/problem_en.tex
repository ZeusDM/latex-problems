Find all positive integers $ n$ for which the numbers in the set $ S = \{1,2, \ldots,n \}$ can be colored red and blue, with the following condition being satisfied: The set $ S \times S \times S$ contains exactly $ 2007$ ordered triples $ \left(x, y, z\right)$ such that:

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
	\item the numbers $ x$,  $ y$,  $ z$ are of the same color, and
	\item the number $ x + y + z$ is divisible by $ n$.
\end{enumerate}
