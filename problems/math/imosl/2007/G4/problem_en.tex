Consider five points $ A$,  $ B$,  $ C$,  $ D$ and $ E$ such that $ ABCD$ is a parallelogram and $ BCED$ is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let $ \ell$ be a line passing through $ A$. Suppose that $ \ell$ intersects the interior of the segment $ DC$ at $ F$ and intersects line $ BC$ at $ G$. Suppose also that $ EF = EG = EC$. Prove that $ \ell$ is the bisector of angle $ DAB$.
