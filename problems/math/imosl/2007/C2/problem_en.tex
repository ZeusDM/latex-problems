A rectangle $ D$ is partitioned in several ($ \ge2$) rectangles with sides parallel to those of $ D$. Given that any line parallel to one of the sides of $ D$,  and having common points with the interior of $ D$,  also has common interior points with the interior of at least one rectangle of the partition; prove that there is at least one rectangle of the partition having no common points with $ D$'s boundary.
