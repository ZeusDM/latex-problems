Point $ P$ lies on side $ AB$ of a convex quadrilateral $ ABCD$. Let $ \omega$ be the incircle of triangle $ CPD$,  and let $ I$ be its incenter. Suppose that $ \omega$ is tangent to the incircles of triangles $ APD$ and $ BPC$ at points $ K$ and $ L$,  respectively. Let lines $ AC$ and $ BD$ meet at $ E$,  and let lines $ AK$ and $ BL$ meet at $ F$. Prove that points $ E$,  $ I$,  and $ F$ are collinear.
