A point $T$ is chosen inside a triangle $ABC$.
Let $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ be the reflections of $T$ in $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively.
Let $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of the triangle $A_1B_1C_1$.
The lines $A_1T$, $B_1T$, and $C_1T$ meet $\Omega$ again at $A_2$, $B_2$, and $C_2$, respectively.
Prove that the lines $AA_2$, $BB_2$, and $CC_2$ are concurrent on $\Omega$.
