Given any set $S$ of positive integers, show that at least one of the following two assertions is true:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item there exist distinct finite subsets $F$ and $G$ of $S$ such that $\sum_{x \in F} 1/x = \sum_{x \in G} 1/x$;

	\item there exists a positive rational number $r < 1$ such that $\sum_{x \in F} 1/x \neq r$, for all finite subsets $F$ of $S$.
\end{enumerate}
