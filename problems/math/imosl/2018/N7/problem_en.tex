Let $n \ge 2018$ be an integer, and let $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ be pairwise distinct positive integers not exceeding $5n$. Suppose that the sequence $$ \dfrac{a_1}{b_1}, \dfrac{a_2}{b_2}, \cdots, \dfrac{a_n}{b_n}$$ forms an arithmetic progression. Prove that the terms of the sequence are equal.
