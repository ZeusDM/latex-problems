Let $m, n \ge 2$ be integers. Let $f(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ be a polynomial with real coefficients such that
\[f(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \left \lfloor{\dfrac{x_1 + \cdots + x_n}{m}}\right \rfloor \quad \text{for every} x_1, \dots, x_n \in \{0, 1, \dots m-1\}.\]
Prove that the total degree of $f$ is at least $n$.
