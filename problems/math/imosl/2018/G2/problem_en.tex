Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=AC$, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Let $P$ be a point such that $PB<PC$ and $PA$ is parallel to $BC$. Let $X$ and $Y$ be points on the lines $PB$ and $PC$, respectively, so that $B$ lies on the segment $PX$, $C$ lies on the segment $PY$, and $\angle PXM=\angle PYM$. Prove that the quadrilateral $APXY$ is cyclic.
