Let $a$ and $b$ be distinct positive integers. The following infinite process takes place on an initially empty board.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item If there is at least a pair of equal numbers on the board, we choose such a pair and increase one of its components by a and the other by b.

	\item If no such pair exists, we write down two times the number 0. 
\end{enumerate}

Prove that, no matter how we make the choices in (\textit{i}), operation (\textit{ii}) will be performed only finitely many times.
