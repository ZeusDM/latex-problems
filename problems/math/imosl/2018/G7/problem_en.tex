Let $O$ be the circumcentre, and $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of an acute-angled triangle $ABC$. Let $P$ be an arbitrary point on $\Omega$, distict from $A$, $B$, $C$, and their antipodes in $\Omega$. Denote the circumcentres od the triangles $AOP$, $BOP$, and $COP$ by $O_A$, $O_B$, and $O_C$, respectively. The lines $\ell_A$, $\ell_B$, and $\ell_C$ are perpendicular to $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ pass through $O_A$, $O_B$, and $O_C$, respectively. Prove that the circumcircle of the triangle formed by $\ell_A$, $\ell_B$, and $\ell_C$ is tangent to the line $OP$.
