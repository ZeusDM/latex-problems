A circle $\omega$ of radius 1 is given. A collection $T$ of triangles is called \textit{good} if the following conditions hold:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item each triangle from $T$ is inscribled in $\omega$;
	\item no two triangles from $T$ have a common interior point.
\end{enumerate}

Determine all the positive real numbers $t$ such that, for each positive integer $n$, there exists a good collection of $n$ triangles, each of perimeter greater than $t$.
