Define the sequence $a_0, a_1, \dots$ by $a_n = 2^n + 2^{\left \lfloor{n/2}\right \rfloor }$. Prove that there are infinitely many terms of the sequence which can be expressed as sum of (two or more) distinct terms of the sequence, as well as infinitely many of those which cannot be expressed in such a way.
