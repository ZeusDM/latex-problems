Let the sides $AD$ and $BC$ of the quadrilateral $ABCD$ (such that $AB$ is not parallel to $CD$) intersect at point $P$. Points $O_1$ and $O_2$ are circumcenters and points $H_1$ and $H_2$ are orthocenters of triangles $ABP$ and $CDP$,  respectively. Denote the midpoints of segments $O_1H_1$ and $O_2H_2$ by $E_1$ and $E_2$,  respectively. Prove that the perpendicular from $E_1$ on $CD$,  the perpendicular from $E_2$ on $AB$ and the lines $H_1H_2$ are concurrent.
