A positive integer $N$ is called balanced, if $N=1$ or if $N$ can be written as a product of an even number of not necessarily distinct primes. Given positive integers $a$ and $b$,  consider the polynomial $P$ defined by $P(x)=(x+a)(x+b)$.

(a) Prove that there exist distinct positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that all the number $P(1)$,  $P(2)$, $\ldots$,  $P(50)$ are balanced.

(b) Prove that if $P(n)$ is balanced for all positive integers $n$,  then $a=b$.
