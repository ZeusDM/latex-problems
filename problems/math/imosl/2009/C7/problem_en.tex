Let $ a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_n$ be distinct positive integers and let $ M$ be a set of $ n - 1$ positive integers not containing $ s = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n.$ A grasshopper is to jump along the real axis, starting at the point $ 0$ and making $ n$ jumps to the right with lengths $ a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_n$ in some order. Prove that the order can be chosen in such a way that the grasshopper never lands on any point in $ M.$
