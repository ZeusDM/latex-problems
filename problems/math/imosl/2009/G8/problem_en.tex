Let $ABCD$ be a circumscribed quadrilateral. Let $g$ be a line through $A$ which meets the segment $BC$ in $M$ and the line $CD$ in $N$. Denote by $I_1$,  $I_2$ and $I_3$ the incenters of $\triangle ABM$,  $\triangle MNC$ and $\triangle NDA$,  respectively. Prove that the orthocenter of $\triangle I_1I_2I_3$ lies on $g$.
