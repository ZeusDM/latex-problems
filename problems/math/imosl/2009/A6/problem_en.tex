Suppose that $ s_1,s_2,s_3, \ldots$ is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers such that the sub-sequences \[s_{s_1},\, s_{s_2},\, s_{s_3},\, \ldots\qquad\text{and}\qquad s_{s_1+1},\, s_{s_2+1},\, s_{s_3+1},\, \ldots\] are both arithmetic progressions. Prove that the sequence $ s_1, s_2, s_3, \ldots$ is itself an arithmetic progression.
