Let $\mathcal L$ be the set of all lines in the plane and let $f$ be a function that assigns to each line $\ell\in\mathcal L$ a point $f(\ell)$ on $f(\ell)$. Suppose that for any point $X$, and for any three lines $\ell_1,\ell_2,\ell_3$ passing through $X$, the points $f(\ell_1),f(\ell_2),f(\ell_3)$, and $X$ lie on a circle.
Prove that there is a unique point $P$ such that $f(\ell)=P$ for any line $\ell$ passing through $P$.
