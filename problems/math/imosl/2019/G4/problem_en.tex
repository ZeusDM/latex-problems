Let $P$ be a point inside triangle $ABC$. Let $AP$ meet $BC$ at $A_1$, let $BP$ meet $CA$ at $B_1$, and let $CP$ meet $AB$ at $C_1$. Let $A_2$ be the point such that $A_1$ is the midpoint of $PA_2$, let $B_2$ be the point such that $B_1$ is the midpoint of $PB_2$, and let $C_2$ be the point such that $C_1$ is the midpoint of $PC_2$. Prove that points $A_2, B_2$, and $C_2$ cannot all lie strictly inside the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$.
