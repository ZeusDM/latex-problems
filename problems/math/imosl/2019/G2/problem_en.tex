Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle and let $D, E$, and $F$ be the feet of altitudes from $A, B$, and $C$ to sides $BC, CA$, and $AB$, respectively. Denote by $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ the incircles of triangles $BDF$ and $CDE$, and let these circles be tangent to segments $DF$ and $DE$ at $M$ and $N$, respectively. Let line $MN$ meet circles $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ again at $P \ne M$ and $Q \ne N$, respectively. Prove that $MP = NQ$.
