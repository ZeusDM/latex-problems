Given trapezoid $ ABCD$ with parallel sides $ AB$ and $ CD$,  assume that there exist points $ E$ on line $ BC$ outside segment $ BC$,  and $ F$ inside segment $ AD$ such that $ \angle DAE = \angle CBF$. Denote by $ I$ the point of intersection of $ CD$ and $ EF$,  and by $ J$ the point of intersection of $ AB$ and $ EF$. Let $ K$ be the midpoint of segment $ EF$,  assume it does not lie on line $ AB$. Prove that $ I$ belongs to the circumcircle of $ ABK$ if and only if $ K$ belongs to the circumcircle of $ CDJ$.
