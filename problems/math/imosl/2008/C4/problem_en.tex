Let $ n$ and $ k$ be positive integers with $ k \geq n$ and $ k - n$ an even number. Let $ 2n$ lamps labelled $ 1$,  $ 2$,  ..., $ 2n$ be given, each of which can be either on or off. Initially all the lamps are off. We consider sequences of steps: at each step one of the lamps is switched (from on to off or from off to on).

Let $ N$ be the number of such sequences consisting of $ k$ steps and resulting in the state where lamps $ 1$ through $ n$ are all on, and lamps $ n + 1$ through $ 2n$ are all off.

Let $ M$ be number of such sequences consisting of $ k$ steps, resulting in the state where lamps $ 1$ through $ n$ are all on, and lamps $ n + 1$ through $ 2n$ are all off, but where none of the lamps $ n + 1$ through $ 2n$ is ever switched on.

Determine $ \frac {N}{M}$.
