Let $ ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with $ BA\neq BC$. Denote the incircles of triangles $ ABC$ and $ ADC$ by $ \omega_{1}$ and $ \omega_{2}$ respectively. Suppose that there exists a circle $ \omega$ tangent to ray $ BA$ beyond $ A$ and to the ray $ BC$ beyond $ C$,  which is also tangent to the lines $ AD$ and $ CD$. Prove that the common external tangents to $ \omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$ intersect on $ \omega$.
