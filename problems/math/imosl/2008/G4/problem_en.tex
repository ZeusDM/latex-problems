In an acute triangle $ ABC$ segments $ BE$ and $ CF$ are altitudes. Two circles passing through the point $ A$ and $ F$ and tangent to the line $ BC$ at the points $ P$ and $ Q$ so that $ B$ lies between $ C$ and $ Q$. Prove that lines $ PE$ and $ QF$ intersect on the circumcircle of triangle $ AEF$.
