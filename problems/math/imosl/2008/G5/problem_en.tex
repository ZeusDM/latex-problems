Let $ k$ and $ n$ be integers with $ 0\le k\le n - 2$. Consider a set $ L$ of $ n$ lines in the plane such that no two of them are parallel and no three have a common point. Denote by $ I$ the set of intersections of lines in $ L$. Let $ O$ be a point in the plane not lying on any line of $ L$. A point $ X\in I$ is colored red if the open line segment $ OX$ intersects at most $ k$ lines in $ L$. Prove that $ I$ contains at least $ \dfrac{1}{2}(k + 1)(k + 2)$ red points.
