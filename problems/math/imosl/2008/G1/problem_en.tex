An acute-angled triangle $ABC$ has orthocentre $H$. The circle passing through $H$ with centre the midpoint of $BC$ intersects the line $BC$ at $A_1$ and $A_2$. Similarly, the circle passing through $H$ with centre the midpoint of $CA$ intersects the line $CA$ at $B_1$ and $B_2$, and the circle passing through $H$ with centre the midpoint of $AB$ intersects the line $AB$ at $C_1$ and $C_2$. Show that $A_1,A_2,B_1,B_2,C_1,C_2$ lie on a circle.
