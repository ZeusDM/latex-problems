Let $ ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral and let $ P$ and $ Q$ be points in $ ABCD$ such that $ PQDA$ and $ QPBC$ are cyclic quadrilaterals. Suppose that there exists a point $ E$ on the line segment $ PQ$ such that $ \angle PAE = \angle QDE$ and $ \angle PBE = \angle QCE$. Show that the quadrilateral $ ABCD$ is cyclic.
