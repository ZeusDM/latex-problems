$N$ coins are placed on a table, $N - 1$ are genuine and have the same weight, and one is fake, with a different weight. Using a two pan balance, the goal is to determine with certainty the fake coin, and whether it is lighter or heavier than a genuine coin. Whenever one can deduce that one or more coins are genuine, they will be inmediately discarded and may no longer be used in subsequent weighings. Determine all $N$ for which the goal is achievable. (There are no limits regarding how many times one may use the balance).

Note: the only difference between genuine and fake coins is their weight; otherwise, they are identical.
