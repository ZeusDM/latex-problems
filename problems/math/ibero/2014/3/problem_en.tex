$2014$ points are placed on a circumference. On each of the segments with end points on two of the $2014$ points is written a non-negative real number. For any convex polygon with vertices on some of the $2014$ points, the sum of the numbers written on their sides is less or equal than $1$. Find the maximum possible value for the sum of all the written numbers.
