The incircle of a triangle $ABC$ touches the sides $BC$,  $CA$,  $AB$ at the points $D$,  $E$,  $F$ respectively. Let the line $AD$ intersect this incircle of triangle $ABC$ at a point $X$ (apart from $D$). Assume that this point $X$ is the midpoint of the segment $AD$,  this means, $AX = XD$. Let the line $BX$ meet the incircle of triangle $ABC$ at a point $Y$ (apart from $X$), and let the line $CX$ meet the incircle of triangle $ABC$ at a point $Z$ (apart from $X$). Show that $EY = FZ$.
