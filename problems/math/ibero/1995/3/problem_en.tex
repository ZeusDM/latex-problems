Let $ r$ and $ s$ two orthogonal lines that does not lay on the same plane. Let $ AB$ be their common perpendicular, where $ A\in{}r$ and $ B\in{}s$(*).Consider the sphere of diameter $ AB$. The points $ M\in{r}$ and $ N\in{s}$ varies with the condition that $ MN$ is tangent to the sphere on the point $ T$. Find the locus of $ T$.

Note: The plane that contains $ B$ and $ r$ is perpendicular to $ s$.
