In a $m\times{n}$ grid are there are token. Every  token dominates  every square on its same row ($\leftrightarrow$), its same column ($\updownarrow$), and diagonal ($\searrow\hspace{-4.45mm}\nwarrow$)(Note that the token does not \emph{dominate} the diagonal ($\nearrow\hspace{-4.45mm}\swarrow$), determine the lowest number of tokens that must be on the board to dominate  all the squares on the board.
