A function $f: \N\rightarrow\N$ is circular if for every $p\in\N$ there exists $n\in\N,\ n\leq{p}$ such that $f^n(p)=p$ ($f$ composed with itself $n$ times) The function $f$ has repulsion degree $k>0$ if for every $p\in\N$ $f^i(p)\neq{p}$ for every $i=1,2,\dots,\lfloor{kp}\rfloor$. Determine the maximum repulsion degree can have a circular function.Note: Here $\lfloor{x}\rfloor$ is the integer part of $x$.
