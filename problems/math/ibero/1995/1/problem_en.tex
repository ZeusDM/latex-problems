Find all the possible values of the sum of the digits of all the perfect squares.

[Commented by djimenez]Comment: I would rewrite it as follows:

Let $f: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that $f(n)$ is the sum of all the digits  of the number $n^2$. Find the image of $f$ (where, by image it is understood the set of all $x$ such that exists an $n$ with $f(n)=x$).
