The numbers $1,\, 2,\, \ldots\, , n^{2}$ are written in the squares of an $n \times n$ board in some order. Initially there is a token on the square labelled with $n^{2}.$ In each step, the token can be moved to any adjacent square (by side). At the beginning, the token is moved to the square labelled with the number $1$ along a path with the minimum number of steps. Then it is moved to the square labelled with $2,$ then to square $3,$ etc, always taking the shortest path, until it returns to the initial square. If the total trip takes $N$ steps, find the smallest and greatest possible values of $N.$
