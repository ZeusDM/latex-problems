In a scalene triangle $ABC$ with $\angle A = 90^\circ,$ the tangent line at $A$ to its circumcircle meets line $BC$ at $M$ and the incircle touches $AC$ at $S$ and $AB$ at $R.$

The lines $RS$ and $BC$ intersect at $N,$ while the lines $AM$ and $SR$ intersect at $U.$

Prove that the triangle $UMN$ is isosceles.
