Consider a regular $n$-gon with $n$ odd. Given two adjacent vertices $A_{1}$ and $A_{2},$ define the sequence $(A_{k})$ of vertices of the $n$-gon as follows: For $k\ge 3,\, A_{k}$ is the vertex lying on the perpendicular bisector of $A_{k-2}A_{k-1}.$ Find all $n$ for which each vertex of the $n$-gon occurs in this sequence.
