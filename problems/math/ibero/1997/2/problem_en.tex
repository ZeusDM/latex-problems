In a triangle $ABC$,  it is drawn a circumference with center in the incenter $I$ and that meet twice each of the sides of the triangle: the segment $BC$ on $D$ and $P$ (where $D$ is nearer two $B$); the segment $CA$ on $E$ and $Q$ (where $E$ is nearer to $C$); and the segment $AB$ on $F$ and $R$ ( where $F$ is nearer to $A$).

Let $S$ be the point of intersection of the diagonals of the quadrilateral $EQFR$. Let $T$ be the point of intersection of the diagonals of the quadrilateral $FRDP$. Let $U$ be the point of intersection of the diagonals of the quadrilateral $DPEQ$.

Show that the circumcircle to the triangle $\triangle{FRT}$,  $\triangle{DPU}$ and $\triangle{EQS}$ have a unique point in common.
