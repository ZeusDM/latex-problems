Let $P = \{P_1, P_2, ..., P_{1997}\}$ be a set of $1997$ points in the interior of a circle of radius 1, where $P_1$ is the center of the circle. For each $k=1.\ldots,1997$,  let $x_k$ be the distance of $P_k$ to the point of $P$ closer to $P_k$,  but different from it. Show that $(x_1)^2 + (x_2)^2 + ... + (x_{1997})^2 \le 9.$
