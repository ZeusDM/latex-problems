In an acute triangle $\triangle{ABC}$,  let $AE$ and $BF$ be highs of it, and $H$ its orthocenter. The symmetric line of $AE$ with respect to the angle bisector of $\sphericalangle{A}$ and the symmetric line of $BF$ with respect to the angle bisector of $\sphericalangle{B}$ intersect each other on the point $O$. The lines $AE$ and $AO$ intersect again the circuncircle to $\triangle{ABC}$ on the points $M$ and $N$ respectively.

Let $P$ be the intersection of $BC$ with $HN$; $R$ the intersection of $BC$ with $OM$; and $S$ the intersection of $HR$ with $OP$. Show that $AHSO$ is a paralelogram.
