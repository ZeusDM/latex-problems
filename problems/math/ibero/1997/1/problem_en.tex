Let $r\geq1$ be areal number that holds with the property that for each pair of positive integer numbers $m$ and $n$,  with $n$ a multiple of $m$,  it is true that $\lfloor{nr}\rfloor$ is multiple of $\lfloor{mr}\rfloor$. Show that $r$ has to be an integer number.Note: If $x$ is a real number, $\lfloor{x}\rfloor$ is the greatest integer lower than or equal to $x$}.
