A flea jumps in a straight numbered line. It jumps first from point $0$ to point $1$. Afterwards, if its last jump was from $A$ to $B$,  then the next jump is from $B$ to one of the points $B + (B - A) - 1$,  $B + (B - A)$,  $B + (B-A) + 1$.

Prove that if the flea arrived twice at the point $n$,  $n$ positive integer, then it performed at least $\lceil 2\sqrt n\rceil$ jumps.
