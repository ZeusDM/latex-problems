Given an acute triangle $ABC$,  let $D$,  $E$ and $F$ be points in the lines $BC$,  $AC$ and $AB$ respectively. If the lines $AD$,  $BE$ and $CF$ pass through $O$ the centre of the circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$,  whose radius is $R$,  show that:\[\frac{1}{AD}+\frac{1}{BE}+\frac{1}{CF}=\frac{2}{R}\]
