A number is called capicua if when it is written in decimal notation, it can be read equal from left to right as from right to left; for example: $8, 23432, 6446$. Let $x_1<x_2<\cdots<x_i<x_{i+1},\cdots$ be the sequence of all capicua numbers. For each $i$ define $y_i=x_{i+1}-x_i$. How many distinct primes contains the set $\{y_1,y_2, \ldots\}$?
