Let $P$ and $Q$ be two distinct points in the plane. Let us denote by $m(PQ)$ the segment bisector of $PQ$. Let $S$ be a finite subset of the plane, with more than one element, that satisfies the following properties:

(i) If $P$ and $Q$ are in $S$,  then $m(PQ)$ intersects $S$.

(ii) If $P_1Q_1, P_2Q_2, P_3Q_3$ are three diferent segments such that its endpoints are points of $S$,  then, there is non point in $S$ such that it intersects the three lines $m(P_1Q_1)$,  $m(P_2Q_2)$,  and $m(P_3Q_3)$.

Find the number of points that $S$ may contain.
