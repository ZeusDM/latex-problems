Two nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$ are tuanis if the decimal expression of $a+b$ contains only $0$ and $1$ as digits. Let $A$ and $B$ be two infinite sets of non negative integers such that $B$ is the set of all the tuanis numbers to elements of the set $A$ and $A$ the set of all the tuanis numbers to elements of the set $B$. Show that in at least one of the sets $A$ and $B$ there is an infinite number of pairs $(x,y)$ such that $x-y=1$.
