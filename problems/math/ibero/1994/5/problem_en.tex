Let $n$ and $r$ two positive integers. It is wanted to make $r$ subsets $A_1,\ A_2,\dots,A_r$ from the set $\{0,1,\cdots,n-1\}$ such that all those subsets contain exactly $k$ elements and such that, for all integer $x$ with $0\leq{x}\leq{n-1}$ there exist $x_1\in{}A_1,\ x_2\in{}A_2 \dots,x_r\in{}A_r$ (an element of each set) with $x=x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_r$.

Find the minimum value of $k$ in terms of $n$ and $r$.
