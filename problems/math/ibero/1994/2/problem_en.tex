Let $ ABCD$ a cuadrilateral inscribed in a circumference. Suppose that there is a semicircle with its center on $ AB$,  that

is tangent to the other three sides of the cuadrilateral.

(i) Show that $ AB = AD + BC$.

(ii) Calculate, in term of $ x = AB$ and $ y = CD$,  the maximal area that can be reached for such quadrilateral.
