Let $A,\ B$ and $C$ be given points on a circumference $K$ such that the triangle $\triangle{ABC}$ is acute. Let $P$ be a point in the interior of $K$. $X,\ Y$ and $Z$ be the other intersection of $AP, BP$ and $CP$  with the circumference. Determine the position of $P$ such that $\triangle{XYZ}$ is equilateral.
