Let $n$ to be a positive integer. Given a set $\{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \} $ of integers, where $a_i \in \{ 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2^n -1 \},$ $\forall i$,  we associate to each of its subsets the sum of its elements; particularly, the empty subset has sum of its elements equal to $0$. If all of these sums have different remainders when divided by $2^n$,  we say that $\{ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \} $ is $n$-complete.

For each $n$,  find the number of $n$-complete sets.
