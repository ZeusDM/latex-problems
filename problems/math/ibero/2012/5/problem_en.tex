Let $ABC$ be a triangle, $P$ and $Q$ the intersections of the parallel line to $BC$ that passes through $A$ with the external angle bisectors of angles $B$ and $C$,  respectively. The perpendicular to $BP$ at $P$ and the perpendicular to $CQ$ at $Q$ meet at $R$. Let $I$ be the incenter of $ABC$. Show that $AI  = AR$.
