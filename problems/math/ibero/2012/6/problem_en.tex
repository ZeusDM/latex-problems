Show that, for every positive integer $n$,  there exist $n$ consecutive positive integers such that none is divisible by the sum of its digits.

(Alternative Formulation: Call a number good if it's not divisible by the sum of its digits. Show that for every positive integer $n$ there are $n$ consecutive good numbers.)
