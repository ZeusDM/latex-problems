Let $\triangle{ABC}$ be a triangle, $D$ the midpoint of $BC$,  and $M$ be the midpoint of $AD$. The line $BM$ intersects the side $AC$ on the point $N$. Show that $AB$ is tangent to the circuncircle to the triangle $\triangle{NBC}$ if and only if the following equality is true:\[\frac{{BM}}{{MN}} =\frac{({BC})^2}{({BN})^2}.\]
