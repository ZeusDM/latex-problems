Three tokens $A$,  $B$,  $C$ are, each one in a vertex of an equilateral triangle of side $n$. Its divided on equilateral triangles of side 1, such as it is shown in the figure for the case $n=3$

Initially, all the lines of the figure are painted blue. The tokens are moving along the lines painting them of red, following the next two rules:(1) First $A$ moves, after that $B$ moves, and then $C$,  by turns. On each turn, the token moves over exactly one line of one of the little triangles, form one side to the other.(2) Non token moves over a line that is already painted red, but it can rest on one endpoint of a side that is already red, even if there is another token there waiting its turn.

Show that for every positive integer $n$ it is possible to paint red all the sides of the little triangles.
