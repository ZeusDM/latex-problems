Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be two circumferences, with centers $O_1$ and $O_2$ respectively, and secants on $M$ and $N$. The line$t$ is the common tangent to  $S_1$ and $S_2$ closer to $M$. The points $A$ and $B$ are the intersection points of $t$ with $S_1$ and $S_2$,  $C$ is the point such that $BC$ is a diameter of $S_2$,  and $D$ the intersection point of the line $O_1O_2$ with the perpendicular line to $AM$ through $B$. Show that $M$,  $D$ and $C$ are collinear.
