A set $X$ of positive integers is said to be iberic if $X$ is a subset of $\{2, 3, \dots, 2018\}$,  and whenever $m, n$ are both in $X$,  $\gcd(m, n)$ is also in $X$. An iberic set is said to be olympic if it is not properly contained in any other iberic set. Find all olympic iberic sets that contain the number $33$.
