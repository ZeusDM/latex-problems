A policeman is trying to catch a robber on a board of $2001\times2001$ squares. They play alternately, and the player whose trun it is moves to a space in one of the following directions: $\downarrow,\rightarrow,\nwarrow$.

If the policeman is on the square in the bottom-right corner, he can go directly to the square in the upper-left corner (the robber can not do this). Initially the policeman is in the central square, and the robber is in the upper-left adjacent square. Show that:$a)$ The robber may move at least $10000$ times before the being captured.$b)$ The policeman has an strategy such that he will eventually catch the robber.

Note: The policeman can catch the robber if he reaches the square where the robber is, but not if the robber enters the square occupied by the policeman.
