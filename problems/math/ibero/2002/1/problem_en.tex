The integer numbers from $1$ to $2002$ are written in a blackboard in increasing order $1,2,\ldots, 2001,2002$. After that, somebody erases the numbers in the $ (3k+1)-th$ places i.e. $(1,4,7,\dots)$. After that, the same person erases the numbers in the $(3k+1)-th$ positions of the new list (in this case, $2,5,9,\ldots$). This process is repeated until one number remains. What is this number?
