Let $S$ be a set of $n$ elements and $S_1,\ S_2,\dots,\ S_k$ are subsets of $S$ ($k\geq2$), such that every one of them has at least $r$ elements.

Show that there exists $i$ and $j$,  with $1\leq{i}<j\leq{k}$,  such that the number of common elements of $S_i$ and $S_j$ is greater or equal to: $r-\frac{nk}{4(k-1)}$
