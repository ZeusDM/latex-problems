The incircle of the triangle $\triangle{ABC}$ has center at $O$ and it is tangent to the sides $BC$,  $AC$ and $AB$ at the points $X$,  $Y$ and $Z$,  respectively. The lines $BO$ and $CO$ intersect the line $YZ$ at the points $P$ and $Q$,  respectively.

Show that if the segments $XP$ and $XQ$ has the same length, then the triangle $\triangle ABC$ is isosceles.
