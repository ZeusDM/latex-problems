We say that a natural number $n$ is charrua if it satisfy simultaneously the following conditions:

- Every digit of $n$ is greater than 1.

- Every time that four digits of $n$ are multiplied, it is obtained a divisor of $n$

Show that every natural number $k$ there exists a charrua number with more than $k$ digits.
