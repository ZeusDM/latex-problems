In a $ 19\times 19$ board, a piece called dragon moves as follows: It travels by four squares (either horizontally or vertically) and then it moves one square more in a direction perpendicular to its previous direction. It is known that, moving so, a dragon can reach every square of the board.

The draconian distance between two squares is defined as the least number of moves a dragon needs to move from one square to the other.

Let $ C$ be a corner square, and $ V$ the square neighbor of $ C$ that has only a point in common with $ C$. Show that there exists a square $ X$ of the board, such that the draconian distance between $ C$ and $ X$ is greater than the draconian distance between $ C$ and $ V$.
