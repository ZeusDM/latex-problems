Let $ \mathcal{F}$ be a family of hexagons $ H$ satisfying the following properties:

i) $ H$ has parallel opposite sides.

ii) Any 3 vertices of $ H$ can be covered with a strip of width 1.

Determine the least $ \ell\in\mathbb{R}$ such that every hexagon belonging to $ \mathcal{F}$ can be covered with a strip of width $ \ell$.

Note: A strip is the area bounded by two parallel lines separated by a distance $ \ell$. The lines belong to the strip, too.
