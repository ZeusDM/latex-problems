Let $P_1,P_2,\dots,P_n$ be $n$ distinct points over a line in the plane ($n\geq2$). Consider all the circumferences with diameters $P_iP_j$ ($1\leq{i,j}\leq{n}$) and they are painted with $k$ given colors. Lets call this configuration a ($n,k$)-cloud.

For each positive integer $k$,  find all the positive integers $n$ such that every possible ($n,k$)-cloud has two mutually exterior tangent circumferences of the same color.
