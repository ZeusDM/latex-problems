Let $A$ and $B$ points in the plane and $C$ a point in the perpendiclar bisector of $AB$. It is constructed a sequence of points $C_1,C_2,\dots, C_n,\dots$ in the following way: $C_1=C$ and for $n\geq1$,  if $C_n$ does not belongs to $AB$,  then $C_{n+1}$ is the circumcentre of the triangle $\triangle{ABC_n}$.

Find all the points $C$ such that the sequence $C_1,C_2,\dots$ is defined for all $n$ and turns eventually periodic.

Note: A sequence $C_1,C_2, \dots$ is called eventually periodic if there exist positive integers $k$ and $p$ such that $C_{n+p}=c_n$ for all $n\geq{k}$.
