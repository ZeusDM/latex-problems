Given two circle $M$ and $N$,  we say that $M$ bisects $N$ if they intersect in two points and the common chord is a diameter of $N$. Consider two fixed non-concentric circles $C_1$ and $C_2$.

a) Show that there exists infinitely many circles $B$ such that $B$ bisects both $C_1$ and $C_2$.

b) Find the locus of the centres of such circles $B$.
