$(a)$There are two sequences of numbers, with $2003$ consecutive integers each, and a table of $2$ rows and $2003$ columns$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline\ \ &\ &\ &\cdots\cdots&\ &\ \\ \hline \ &\ &\ &\cdots\cdots&\ &\ \\ \hline \end{array}$

Is it always possible to arrange the numbers in the first sequence in the first row and the second sequence in the second row, such that the sequence obtained of the $2003$ column-wise sums form a new sequence of $2003$ consecutive integers?$(b)$ What if $2003$ is replaced with $2004$?
