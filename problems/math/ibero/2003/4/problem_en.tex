Let $M=\{1,2,\dots,49\}$ be the set of the first $49$ positive integers. Determine the maximum integer $k$ such that the set $M$ has a subset of $k$ elements such that there is no $6$ consecutive integers in such subset. For this value of $k$,  find the number of subsets of $M$ with $k$ elements with the given property.
