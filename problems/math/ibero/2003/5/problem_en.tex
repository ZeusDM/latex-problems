In a square $ABCD$,  let $P$ and $Q$ be points on the sides $BC$ and $CD$ respectively, different from its endpoints, such that $BP=CQ$. Consider points $X$ and $Y$ such that $X\neq Y$,  in the segments $AP$ and $AQ$ respectively. Show that, for every $X$ and $Y$ chosen, there exists a triangle whose sides have lengths $BX$,  $XY$ and $DY$.
