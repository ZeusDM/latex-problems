Let $C$ and $D$ be two points on the semicricle with diameter $AB$ such that $B$ and $C$ are on distinct sides of the line $AD$. Denote by $M$,  $N$ and $P$ the midpoints of $AC$,  $BD$ and $CD$ respectively. Let $O_A$ and $O_B$ the circumcentres of the triangles $ACP$ and $BDP$. Show that the lines $O_AO_B$ and $MN$ are parallel.
