Let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. The line parallel to $AC$ passing through $B$ meets $\Gamma$ at $D$ ($D\neq B$), and the line parallel to $AB$ passing through $C$ intersects $\Gamma$ to $E$ ($E\neq C$). Lines $AB$ and $CD$ meet at $P$,  and lines $AC$ and $BE$ meet at $Q$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $DE$. Line $AM$ meets $\Gamma$ at $Y$ ($Y\neq A$) and line $PQ$ at $J$. Line $PQ$ intersects the circumcircle of triangle $BCJ$ at $Z$ ($Z\neq J$). If lines $BQ$ and $CP$ meet each other at $X$,  show that $X$ lies on the line $YZ$.
