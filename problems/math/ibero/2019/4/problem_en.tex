Let $ABCD$ be a trapezoid with $AB\parallel CD$ and inscribed in a circumference $\Gamma$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be two points on segment $AB$ ($A$,  $P$,  $Q$,  $B$ appear in that order and are distinct) such that $AP=QB$. Let $E$ and $F$ be the second intersection points of lines $CP$ and $CQ$ with $\Gamma$,  respectively. Lines $AB$ and $EF$ intersect at $G$. Prove that line $DG$ is tangent to $\Gamma$.
