A set $S$ of positive integers is said to be channeler if for any three distinct numbers $a,b,c \in S$,  we have $a\mid bc$,  $b\mid ca$,  $c\mid ab$.

a) Prove that for any finite set of positive integers $ \{ c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n \} $ there exist infinitely many positive integers $k$,  such that the set $ \{ kc_1, kc_2, \ldots, kc_n \} $ is a channeler set.

b) Prove that for any integer $n \ge 3$ there is a channeler set who has exactly $n$ elements, and such that no integer greater than $1$ divides all of its elements.
