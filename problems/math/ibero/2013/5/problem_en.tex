Let $A$ and $B$ be two sets such that $A \cup B$ is the set of the positive integers, and $A \cap B$ is the empty set. It is known that if two positive integers have a prime larger than $2013$ as their difference, then one of them is in $A$ and the other is in $B$. Find all the possibilities for the sets $A$ and $B$.
