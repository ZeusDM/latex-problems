Let $X$ and $Y$ be the diameter's extremes of a circunference $\Gamma$ and $N$ be the midpoint of one of the arcs $XY$ of $\Gamma$. Let $A$ and $B$ be two points on the segment $XY$. The lines $NA$ and $NB$ cuts $\Gamma$ again in $C$ and $D$,  respectively.  The tangents to $\Gamma$ at $C$ and at $D$ meets in $P$. Let $M$ the the intersection point between $XY$ and $NP$. Prove that $M$ is the midpoint of the segment $AB$.
