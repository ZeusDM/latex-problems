The circle $ \Gamma $ is inscribed to the scalene triangle  $ABC$. $ \Gamma $ is tangent to the sides $BC, CA$ and $AB$ at $D, E$ and $F$ respectively. The line $EF$ intersects the line $BC$ at $G$. The circle of diameter $GD$ intersects $ \Gamma $  in $R$ ($ R\neq D $). Let $P$,  $Q$ ($ P\neq R , Q\neq R $)  be the intersections of $ \Gamma $  with $BR$ and $CR$,  respectively. The lines $BQ$ and $CP$ intersects at $X$. The circumcircle of $CDE$ meets $QR$ at $M$,  and the circumcircle of $BDF$ meet $PR$ at $N$. Prove that $PM$,  $QN$ and $RX$ are concurrent.
