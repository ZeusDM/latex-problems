Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral whose diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ are perpendicular. Let $O$ be the circumcenter of $ABCD$,  $K$ the intersection of the diagonals,  $ L\neq O $ the intersection of the circles circumscribed to $OAC$ and $OBD$,  and $G$ the intersection of the diagonals of the quadrilateral whose vertices are the midpoints of the sides of $ABCD$. Prove that $O, K, L$ and $G$ are collinear
