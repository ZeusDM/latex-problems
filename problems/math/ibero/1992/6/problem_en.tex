In a triangle $ABC$,  points $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are chosen in the prolongations beyond $A$ of segments $AB$ and $AC$,  such that $AA_{1}=AA_{2}=BC$. Define analogously points $B_{1}$,  $B_{2}$,  $C_{1}$,  $C_{2}$. If $[ABC]$ denotes the area of triangle $ABC$,  show that $[A_{1}A_{2}B_{1}B_{2}C_{1}C_{2}] \geq 13 [ABC]$.
