Let $ABC$ be an acute angled triangle and $\Gamma$ its circumcircle. Led $D$ be a point on segment $BC$,  different from $B$ and $C$,  and let $M$ be the midpoint of $AD$. The line perpendicular to $AB$ that passes through $D$ intersects $AB$ in $E$ and $\Gamma$ in $F$,  with point $D$ between $E$ and $F$. Lines $FC$ and $EM$ intersect at point $X$. If $\angle DAE = \angle AFE$,  show that line $AX$ is tangent to $\Gamma$.
