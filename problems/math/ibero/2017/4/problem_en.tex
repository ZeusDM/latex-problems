Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $AC > AB$ and $O$ its circumcenter. Let $D$ be a point on segment $BC$ such that $O$ lies inside triangle $ADC$ and $\angle DAO + \angle ADB = \angle ADC$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be the circumcenters of triangles $ABD$ and $ACD$ respectively, and let $M$ be the intersection of lines $BP$ and $CQ$. Show that lines $AM, PQ$ and $BC$ are concurrent.Pablo Ja√©n, Panama
