The number $2$ is written on the board. Ana and Bruno play alternately. Ana begins. Each one, in their turn, replaces the number written by the one obtained by applying exactly one of these operations: multiply the number by $2$,  multiply the number by $3$ or add $1$ to the number. The first player to get a number greater than or equal to $2011$ wins. Find which of the two players has a winning strategy and describe it.
