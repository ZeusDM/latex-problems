Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $X,Y,Z$ be the tangency points of its inscribed circle with the sides $BC, CA, AB$,  respectively. Suppose that $C_1, C_2, C_3$ are circle with chords $YZ, ZX, XY$,  respectively, such that $C_1$ and $C_2$ intersect on the line $CZ$ and that $C_1$ and $C_3$ intersect on the line $BY$. Suppose that $C_1$ intersects the chords $XY$ and $ZX$ at $J$ and $M$,  respectively; that $C_2$ intersects the chords $YZ$ and $XY$ at $L$ and $I$,  respectively; and that $C_3$ intersects the chords $YZ$ and $ZX$ at $K$ and $N$,  respectively. Show that $I, J, K, L, M, N$ lie on the same circle.
