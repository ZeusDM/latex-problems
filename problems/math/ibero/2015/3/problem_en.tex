Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be the roots of $x^{2} - qx + 1$,  where $q$ is a rational number larger than $2$. Let $s_1 = \alpha + \beta$,  $t_1 = 1$,  and for all integers $n \geq 2$:$s_n = \alpha^n + \beta^n$$t_n = s_{n-1} + 2s_{n-2} + \cdot \cdot \cdot + (n - 1)s_{1} + n$

Prove that, for all odd integers $n$,  $t_n$ is the square of a rational number.
