Beto plays the following game with his computer: initially the computer randomly picks $30$ integers from $1$ to $2015$,  and Beto writes them on a chalkboard (there may be repeated numbers). On each turn, Beto chooses a positive integer $k$ and some if the numbers written on the chalkboard, and subtracts $k$ from each of the chosen numbers, with the condition that the resulting numbers remain non-negative. The objective of the game is to reduce all $30$ numbers to $0$,  in which case the game ends. Find the minimal number $n$ such that, regardless of which numbers the computer chooses, Beto can end the game in at most $n$ turns.
