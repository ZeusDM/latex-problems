Given a positive integer $ n\geq 2$,  consider a set of $ n$ islands arranged in a circle. Between every two neigboring islands two bridges are built as shown in the figure.

Starting at the island $ X_1$,  in how many ways one can one can cross the $ 2n$ bridges so that no bridge is used more than once?
