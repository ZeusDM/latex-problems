Let $b$,  $c$ be integer numbers, and define $f(x)=(x+b)^2-c$.

i) If $p$ is a prime number such that $c$ is divisible by $p$ but not by $p^{2}$,  show that for every integer $n$,  $f(n)$ is not divisible by $p^{2}$.

ii) Let $q \neq 2$ be a  prime divisor of $c$. If $q$ divides $f(n)$ for some integer $n$,  show that for every integer $r$ there exists an integer $n'$ such that $f(n')$ is divisible by $qr$.
