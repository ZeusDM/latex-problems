Determine the maximum number of bishops that we can place in a $8 \times 8$ chessboard such that there are not two bishops in the same cell, and each bishop is threatened by at most one bishop.

Note: A bishop threatens another one, if both are placed in different cells, in the same diagonal. A board has as diagonals the $2$ main diagonals and the ones parallel to those ones.
