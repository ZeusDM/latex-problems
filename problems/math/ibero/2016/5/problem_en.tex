The circumferences $C_1$ and $C_2$ cut each other at different points $A$ and $K$. The common tangent to $C_1$ and $C_2$ nearer to $K$ touches $C_1$ at $B$ and $C_2$ at $C$. Let $P$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $B$ to $AC$,  and let $Q$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $C$ to $AB$. If $E$ and $F$ are the symmetric points of $K$ with respect  to the lines $PQ$ and $BC$,  respectively, prove that $A, E$ and $F$ are collinear.
