Note that the probability that the leftmost white point is $x$ is $1019\left(1-x\right)^{1018}$ and the probability that the rightmost black point is $y$ is $1000y^{999}$. Thus the probability that the sum is at most $1$ is \[\displaystyle\int_0^1\displaystyle\int_0^{1-x}1019\left(1-x\right)^{1018}\cdot1000y^{999}dydx=\displaystyle\int_0^11019\left(1-x\right)^{1018}\left(1-x\right)^{1000}dx=\boxed{\frac{1019}{2019}}\] as desired.
