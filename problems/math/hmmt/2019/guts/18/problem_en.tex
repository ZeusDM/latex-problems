$2019$ points are chosen independently and uniformly at random on the interval $\left[0,1\right]$. Tairitsu picks $1000$ of them randomly and colors them black, leaving the remaining ones white. Hikari then computes the sum of the positions of the leftmost white point and the rightmost black point. What is the probability that this sum is at most $1$?
