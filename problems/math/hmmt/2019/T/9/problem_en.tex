Let $p>2$ be a prime number. $\mathbb{F}_p\left[x\right]$ is defined as the set of all polynomials in $x$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_p$ (the integers modulo $p$ with usual addition and subtraction), so that two polynomials are equal if and only if the coefficients of $x^k$ are equal in $\mathbb{F}_p$ for each nonnegative integer $k$. For example, $\left(x+2\right)\left(2x+3\right)=2x^2+2x+1$ in $\mathbb{F}_5\left[x\right]$ because the corresponding coefficients are equal modulo $5$.

Let $f,g\in\mathbb{F}_p\left[x\right]$. The pair $\left(f,g\right)$ is called \emph{compositional} if \[f\left(g\left(x\right)\right)\equiv x^{p^2}-x\] in $\mathbb{F}_p\left[x\right]$. Find, with proof, the number of compositional pairs (in terms of $p$).
