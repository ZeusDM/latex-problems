Consider an affine transformation which sends $A\to\left(0,0\right),B\to\left(1,0\right),C\to\left(1,1\right),D\to\left(0,1\right)$. This works because ratios along lines are preserved. Let $X=\left(\frac{1}{m},0\right)$ and $Y=\left(\frac{1}{n},0\right)$, then confirm that $Z=\left(\frac{1}{m+n},\frac{1}{m+n}\right)$. The conclusion follows.
