Tessa the hyper-ant has a 2019-dimensional hypercube. For a real number $k$, she calls a placement of nonzero real numbers on the $2^{2019}$ vertices of the hypercube \textit{-harmonic} if for any vertex, the sum of all 2019 numbers that are edge-adjacent to this vertex is equal to $k$ times the number on this vertex. Let $S$ be the set of all possible values of $k$ such that there exists a $k$-harmonic placement. Find $\sum_{k \in S} |k|$.
