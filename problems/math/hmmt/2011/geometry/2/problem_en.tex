Let $H$ be a regular hexagon of side length  Call a hexagon in the same plane a "distortion" of $H$ if
and only if it can be obtained from $H$ by translating each vertex of $H$ by a distance strictly less than  Determine the smallest value of $x$ for which every distortion of $H$ is necessarily convex.
