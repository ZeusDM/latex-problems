Let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ be two circles that intersect at points $A$ and  Let line $l$ be tangent to $\omega_1$ at $P$ and to $\omega_2$ at $Q$ such that $A$ is closer to $PQ$ than  Let points $R$ and $S$ lie along rays $PA$ and  respectively, so that $PQ = AR = AS$ and $R$ and $S$ are on opposite sides of $A$ as $P$ and  Let $O$ be the circumcenter of triangle  and $C$ and $D$ be the midpoints of major arcs $AP$ and  respectively. If $\angle APQ$ is $45$ degrees and $\angle AQP$ is $30$ degrees, determine $\angle COD$ in degrees.
