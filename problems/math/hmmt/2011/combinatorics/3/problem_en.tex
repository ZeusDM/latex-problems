Nathaniel and Obediah play a game in which they take turns rolling a fair six-sided die and keep a
running tally of the sum of the results of all rolls made. A player wins if, after he rolls, the number on the running tally is a multiple of 7. Play continues until either player wins, or else indenitely. If Nathaniel goes first, determine the probability that he ends up winning.
