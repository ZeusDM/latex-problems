The numbers $1, 2, \dots, 10$ are written in a circle. There are four people, and each person randomly selects five consecutive integers (e.g., $1, 2, 3, 4, 5$, or $8, 9, 10, 1, 2$). If the probability that there exists some number that is not selected by any of the four people is $p$, compute $10000p$.
