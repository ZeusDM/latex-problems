Two players play a game where they are each given $10$ indistinguishable units that must be distributed across three locations. (Units cannot be split.) At each location, a player wins at that location if the number of units they placed there is at least $2$ more than the units of the other player. If both players distribute their units randomly (i.e. there is an actual probability of them distributing their units for any attainable distribution across the $3$ locations), the probability that at least one location is won by one of the players can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100a + b$.
