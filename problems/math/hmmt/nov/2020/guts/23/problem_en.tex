Two points are chosen inside the square $\{(x, y) \mid 0 \le x, y \le 1\}$ uniformly at random, and a unit square is drawn centered at each point with edges parallel to the coordinate axes. The expected area of the union of the two squares can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b},$ where $a, b$ are relatively prime. Compute $100a + b$.
