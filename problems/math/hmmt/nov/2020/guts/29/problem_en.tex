In $\triangle ABC$, let $H$ be the orthocenter and $D$ the foot of the altitude from $A$. The circumcircle of $\triangle BHC$ intersects $AC$ at $E \neq C$, and $AB$ at $F \neq B$. If $BD = 3$, $CD = 7$, and $AH : HD = 5 : 7$, the area of $\triangle AEF$ can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers. Compute $100a + b$.
