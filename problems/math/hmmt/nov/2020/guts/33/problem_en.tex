In a quadrilateral $ABCD$, there exists a point $E$ on segment $AD$ such that $AE : ED = 1 : 9$ and $\angle BEC$ is a right angle. Additioonally, the area of triangle $CED$ is $27$ times more than the area of triangle $AEB$. If $\angle EBC = \angle EAB$, $\angle ECB = \angle EDC$, and $BC = 6$, compute the value of $AD^2$.
