A fair coin is flipped eight times in a row. Let $p$ be the probability that there is exactly one pair of consecutive flips that are both heads and exactly one pair of consecutive flips that are both tails. If $p = \frac{a}{b}$, where $a, b$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a + b$.
