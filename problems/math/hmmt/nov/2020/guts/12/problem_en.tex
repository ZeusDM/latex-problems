In a single-elimination tournment consisting of $2^9 = 512$ teams, there is a strict ordering on the skill levels of the teams, but \playerA{Joy} does not know that ordering. The teams are randomly put into a bracket and they play out the tournament, where the better team always beats the worse team. \playerA{Joy} is then given the results of all $511$ matches and must write a list of teams such that she can guarantee that the third-best team is on that list. What is the minimum possible length of \playerA{Joy}'s list?
