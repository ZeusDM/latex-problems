A small village has $n$ people. During their yearly elections, groups of three people come up to a stage and vote for someone in the village to be the new leader. After every possible group of three people has voted for someone, the person with the most votes wins. This year, it turned out that everyone in the village had the exact same number of votes! If $10 \le n \le 100$, what is the number of possible values of $n$?
