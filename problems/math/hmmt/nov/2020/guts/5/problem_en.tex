The points $(0, 0)$, $(1, 2)$, $(2, 1)$, $(2, 2)$ in the plane are colored red while the points $(1, 0)$, $(2, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, $(0, 2)$ are colored blue. Four segments are drawn such that each one connects a red point to a blue point and each colored point is the endpoint of some segment. The smaillest possible sum of the lengths of the segments can be expressed as $a + \sqrt{b}$, where $a, b$ are positive integers. Compute $100a + b$.
