Let $\omega_1$ be a circle of radius $5$, and let $\omega_2$ be a circle with radius $2$ whose center lies on $\omega_1$. Let the two circles intersect at $A$ and $B$, and let the tangents to $\omega_2$ at $A$ and $B$ intersect at $P$. If the area of $\triangle ABP$ can be expressed as $\frac{a\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $b$ is square-free and $a, c$ are relatively prime positive integers, compute $100a + 10b + c$.
