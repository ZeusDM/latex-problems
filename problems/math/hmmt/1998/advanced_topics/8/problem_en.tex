Given any two positive real numbers $x$ and  then $x\Diamond y$ is a positive real number defined in terms of $x$ and $y$ by some fixed rule.  Suppose the operation $x\Diamond y$ satisfies the equations $(x\cdot y)\Diamond y=x(y\Diamond y)$ and $(x\Diamond 1)\Diamond x=x\Diamond 1$ for all   Given that  find
