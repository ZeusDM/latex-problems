The Houson Association of Mathematics Educators decides to hold a grand forum on mathematics education and invites a number of politicians from around the United States to participate. Around lunch time the politicians decide to play a game. In this game, players can score $19$ points for pegging the coordinator of the gathering with a spit ball, $9$ points for downing an entire cup of the forumâ€™s interpretation of coffee, or $8$ points for quoting more than three consecutive words from the speech Senator Bobbo delivered before lunch. What is the product of the two greatest scores that a player cannot score in this game?
