Let $n>1$ be a positive integer. Each unit square in an $n \times n$ grid of squares is colored either black or white, such that the following conditions hold:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Any two black squares can be connected by a sequence of black squares where every two consecutive squares in the sequence share an edge;
	\item Any two white squares can be connected by a sequence of white squares where every two consecutive squares in the sequence share an edge;
	\item Any $2 \times 2$ subgrid contains at least one square of each color.
\end{itemize}
Determine, with proof, the maximum possible difference between the number of black squares and white squares in this grid (in terms of $n$).
