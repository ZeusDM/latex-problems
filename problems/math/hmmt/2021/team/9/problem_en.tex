Let scalene triangle $ABC$ have circumcenter $O$ and incenter $I$.
Its incircle $\omega$ is tangent to sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ at $D$, $E$, and $F$, respectively.
Let $P$ be the foot of the altitude from $D$ to $EF$, and let line $DP$ intersect $\omega$ again at $Q \ne D$.
The line $OI$ intersects the altitude from $A$ to$ BC$ at $T$.
Given that $OI \parallel BC$, show that $PQ=PT$.
