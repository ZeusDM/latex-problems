Alex is stuck on a platform floating over an abyss at $1$ ft/s. An evil physicist has arranged for the platform to fall in (taking Alex with it) after traveling t. One minute after the platform was launched, Edward arrives with a second platform capable of floating all the way across the abyss. He calculates for 5 seconds, then launches the second platform in such a way as to maximize the time that one end of Alex's platform is between the two ends of the new platform, thus giving Alex as much time as possible to switch. If both platforms are $5$ ft long and move with constant velocity once launched, what is the speed of the second platform (in ft/s)?
