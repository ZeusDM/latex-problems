You are trapped in a room with only one exit, a long hallway with a series of doors and land mines. To get out you must open all the doors and disarm all the mines. In the room is a panel with $3$ buttons, which conveniently contains an instruction manual. The red button arms a mine, the yellow button disarms two mines and closes a door, and the green button opens two doors. Initially $3$ doors are closed and $3$ mines are armed. The manual warns that attempting to disarm two mines or open two doors when only one is armed/closed will reset the system to its initial state. What is the minimum number of buttons you must push to get out?
