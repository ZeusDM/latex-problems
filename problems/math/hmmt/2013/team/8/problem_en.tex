Let points $A$ and $B$ be on circle $\omega$ centered at  Suppose that $\omega_A$ and $\omega_B$ are circles not containing $O$ which are internally tangent to $\omega$ at $A$ and  respectively. Let $\omega_A$ and $\omega_B$ intersect at $C$ and $D$ such that $D$ is inside triangle  Suppose that line $BC$ meets $\omega$ again at $E$ and let line $EA$ intersect $\omega_A$ at  If  prove that   and $D$ are collinear.
