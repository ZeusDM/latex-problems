Chim Tu has a large rectangular table. On it, there are ﬁnitely many pieces of paper with nonoverlapping interiors, each one in the shape of a convex polygon. At each step, Chim Tu is allowed to slide one piece of paper in a straight line such that its interior does not touch any other piece of paper during the slide.
