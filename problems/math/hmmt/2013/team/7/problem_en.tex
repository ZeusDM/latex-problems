There are are $n$ children and $n$ toys such that each child has a strict preference ordering on the toys. We want to distribute the toys: say a distribution $A$ dominates a distribution $ B \ne A $ if in  each child receives at least as preferable of a toy as in  Prove that if some distribution is not dominated by any other, then at least one child gets his/her favorite toy in that distribution.
