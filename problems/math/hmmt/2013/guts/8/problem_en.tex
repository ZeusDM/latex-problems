In a game, there are three indistinguishable boxes; one box contains two red balls, one contains two blue balls, and the last contains one ball of each color. To play, Raj first predicts whether he will draw two balls of the same color or two of different colors. Then, he picks a box, draws a ball at random,
looks at the color, and replaces the ball in the same box. Finally, he repeats this; however, the boxes are not shuffled between draws, so he can determine whether he wants to draw again from the same box. Raj wins if he predicts correctly; if he plays optimally, what is the probability that he will win?
