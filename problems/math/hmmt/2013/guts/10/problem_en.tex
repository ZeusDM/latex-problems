Wesyu is a farmer, and she's building a cao (a relative of the cow) pasture.  Shw starts with a triangle $A_0A_1A_2$ where angle $A_0$ is $90^\circ$, angle $A_1$ is $60^\circ$, and $A_0A_1$ is $1$.  She then extends the pasture.  FIrst, she extends $A_2A_0$ to $A_3$ such that $A_3A_0=\dfrac12A_2A_0$ and the new pasture is triangle $A_1A_2A_3$.  Next, she extends $A_3A_1$ to $A_4$ such that $A_4A_1=\dfrac16A_3A_1$.  She continues, each time extending $A_nA_{n-2}$ to $A_{n+1}$ such that $A_{n+1}A_{n-2}=\dfrac1{2^n-2}A_nA_{n-2}$.  What is the smallest $K$ such that her pasture never exceeds an area of $K$?
