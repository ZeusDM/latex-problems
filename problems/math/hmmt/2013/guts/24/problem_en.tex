Given a point $p$ and a line segment  let $d(p,l)$ be the distance between them.  Let   and $C$ be points in the plane such that     What is the area of the region in the plane formed by the ordered pairs $(x,y)$ such that there exists a point $P$ inside triangle $ABC$ with $d(P,AB)+x=d(P,BC)+y=d(P,AC)?$
