Sherry and Val are playing a game. Sherry has a deck containing $2011$ red cards and $2012$ black cards, shuffled randomly. Sherry flips these cards over one at a time, and before she flips each card over, Val guesses whether it is red or black. If Val guesses correctly, she wins $1$ dollar; otherwise, she loses $1$ dollar. In addition, Val must guess red exactly $2011$ times. If Val plays optimally, what is her expected profit from this game?
