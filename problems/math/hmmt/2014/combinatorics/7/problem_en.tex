Six distinguishable players are participating in a tennis tournament. Each player plays one match of tennis against every other player. The outcome of each tennis match is a win for one player and a loss for the other players; there are no ties. Suppose that whenever $A$ and $B$ are players in the tournament for which $A$ won (strictly) more matches than $B$ over the course of the tournament, it is also the case that $A$ won the match against $B$ during the tournament. In how many ways could the tournament have gone?
