Bob writes a random string of $5$ letters, where each letter is either $A, B, C,$ or  The letter in each position is independently chosen, and each of the letters $A, B, C, D$ is chosen with equal probability. Given that there are at least two $A's$ in the string, find the probability that there are at least three $A's$ in the string.
