Two circles are said to be \textit{orthogonal} if they intersect in two points, and their tangents at either point of intersection are perpendicular. Two circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ with radii $10$ and  respectively, are externally tangent at point  Another circle $\omega_3$ with radius $2\sqrt2$ passes through $P$ and is orthogonal to both $\omega_1$ and  A fourth circle  orthogonal to  is externally tangent to $\omega_1$ and  Compute the radius of
