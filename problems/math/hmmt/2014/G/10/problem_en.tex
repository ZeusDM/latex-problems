Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=13$, $BC=14$, and $CA=15$. Let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of $ABC$, let $O$ be its circumcenter, and let $M$ be the midpoint of minor arc $\widehat{BC}$. Circle $\omega_1$ is internally tangent to $\Gamma$ at $A$, and circle $\omega_2$, centered at $M$, is externally tangent to $\omega_1$ at a point $T$. Ray $AT$ meets segment $BC$ at point $S$, such that $BS-CS=\frac{4}{15}$. Find the radius of $\omega_2$.
