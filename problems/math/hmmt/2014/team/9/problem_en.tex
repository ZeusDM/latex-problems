For integers  let $A(n,m)$ be the number of sequences $(a_1,\cdots,a_{nm})$ of integers satisfying the following two properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each integer $k$ with $1\leq k\leq n$ occurs exactly $m$ times in the sequence 
	\item If $i,j,$ and $k$ are integers such that $1\leq i\leq nm$ and  then $j$ occurs in the sequence $(a_1,\cdots,a_i)$ at least as many times as $k$ does.
\end{itemize}

For example, if $n=2$ and  a possible sequence is   On the other hand, the sequence $(a_1,\cdots,a_{10})=(1,2,1,2,2,1,1,1,2,2)$ does not satisfy property (2) for   and
