There are $n$ girls $G_1,\ldots, G_n$ and $n$ boys   A pair $(G_i,B_j)$ is called $\textit{suitable}$ if and only if girl $G_i$ is willing to marry boy   Given that there is exactly one way to pair each girl with a distinct boy that she is willing to marry, what is the maximal possible number of suitable pairs?
