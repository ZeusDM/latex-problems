Natalie has a copy of the unit interval $[0,1]$ that is colored white. She also has a black marker, and she colors the interval in the following manner: at each step, she selects a value $x\in [0,1]$ uniformly at random, and

(a) If $x\leq\tfrac12$ she colors the interval $[x,x+\tfrac12]$ with her marker.

(b) If $x>\tfrac12$ she colors the intervals $[x,1]$ and $[0,x-\tfrac12]$ with her marker.

What is the expected value of the number of steps Natalie will need to color the entire interval black?
