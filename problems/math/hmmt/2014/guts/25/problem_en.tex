Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle of side length $6$ inscribed in a circle   Let $A_1,A_2$ be the points (distinct from  where the lines through $A$ passing through the two trisection points of $BC$ meet   Define $B_1,B_2,C_1,C_2$ similarly.  Given that $A_1,A_2,B_1,B_2,C_1,C_2$ appear on $\omega$ in that order, find the area of hexagon
