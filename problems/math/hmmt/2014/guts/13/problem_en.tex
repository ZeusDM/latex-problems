An auditorium has two rows of seats, with $50$ seats in each row. $100$ indistinguishable people sit in the seats one at a time, subject to the condition that each person, except for the first person to sit in each row, must sit to the left or right of an occupied seat, and no two people can sit in the same seat. In how many ways can this process occur?
