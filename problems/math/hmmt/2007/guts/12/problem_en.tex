Let $A_{11}$ denote the answer to problem   Determine the smallest prime $p$ such that the arithmetic sequence $p,p+A_{11},p+2A_{11},\cdots$ begins with the largest number of primes.

There is just one triple of possible $(A_{10},A_{11},A_{12})$ of answers to these three problems. Your team will receive credit only for answers matching these. (So, for example, submitting a wrong answer for problem $11$ will not alter the correctness of your answer to problem )
