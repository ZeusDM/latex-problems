\textit{The Algorithm.} There are thirteen broken computers situated at the following set $S$ of thirteen points in the plane:

\[\begin{array}{ccc}A=(1,10)&B=(976,9)&C=(666,87)\\D=(377,422)&E=(535,488)&F=(775,488) \\ G=(941,500) & H=(225,583)&I=(388,696)\\J=(3,713)&K=(504,872)&L=(560,934)\\&M=(22,997)&\end{array}\]

At time  a repairman begins moving from one computer to the next, traveling continuously in straight lines at unit speed. Assuming the repairman begins and $A$ and Ô¨Åxes computers instantly, what path does he take to minimize the \textit{total downtime} of the computers?  List the points he visits in order.  Your score will be  where \[N=1000+\lfloor\text{the optimal downtime}\rfloor - \lfloor \text{your downtime}\rfloor ,\] or  whichever is greater.  By total downtime we mean the sum \[\sum_{P\in S}t_P,\] where $t_P$ is the time at which the repairman reaches
