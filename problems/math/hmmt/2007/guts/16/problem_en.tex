Let $ABC$ be a triangle with   and   Let $D$ be the point such that $AB\parallel CD$ amd   Let $R$ be a point within triangle   Lines $\ell$ and $m$ going through $R$ are parallel to $CA$ and $AB$ respectively.  Line $\ell$ meets $AB$ and $BC$ at $P$ and $P^\prime$ respectively, and $m$ meets $CA$ and $BC$ at $Q$ and $Q^\prime$ respectively.  If $S$ denotes the largest possible sum of the areas of triangle   and  determine the value of
