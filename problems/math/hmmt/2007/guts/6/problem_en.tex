There are three video game systems: the Paystation, the WHAT, and the ZBoz and none of these systems will play games for the other systems. Uncle Riemann has three nephews: Bernoulli, Galois, and Dirac. Bernoulli owns a Paystation and a WHAT, Galois owns a WHAT and a ZBoz and Dirac owns a ZBoz and a Paystation. A store sells $4$ diﬀerent games for the Paystation, $6$ diﬀerent games for the WHAT, and $10$ diﬀerent games for the ZBoz Uncle Riemann does not understand the diﬀerence between the systems, so he walks into the store and buys $3$ random games (not necessarily distinct) and randomly hands them to his nephews. What is the probability that each nephew receives a game he can play?
