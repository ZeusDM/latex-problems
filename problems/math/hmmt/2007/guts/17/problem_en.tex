During the regular season, Washington Redskins achieve a record of $10$ wins and $6$ losses. Compute the probability that their wins came in three streaks of consecutive wins, assuming that all possible arrangements of wins and losses are equally likely. (For example, the record $LLWWWWWLWWLWWWLL$ contains three winning streaks, while $WWWWWWWLLLLLLWWW$ has just two.)
