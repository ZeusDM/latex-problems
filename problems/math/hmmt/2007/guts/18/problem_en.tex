Convex quadrilateral $ABCD$ has right angles $\angle A$ and $\angle C$ and is such that $AB=BC$ and   The diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at point   Points $P$ and $Q$ lie on the circumcircle of triangle $AMB$ and segment  respectively, such that points   and $Q$ are collinear.  Suppose that $m\angle ABC=160^\circ$ and   Find  given that
