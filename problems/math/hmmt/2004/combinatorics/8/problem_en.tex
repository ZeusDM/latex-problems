Urn A contains 4 white balls and 2 red balls. Urn B contains 3 red balls and 3 black balls. An urn is randomly selected, and then a ball inside of that urn is removed. We then repeat the process of selecting an urn and drawing out a ball, without returning the first ball. What is the probability that the first ball drawn was red, given that the second ball drawn was black?
