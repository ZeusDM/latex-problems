A classroom consists of a $5\times5$ array of desks, to be filled by anywhere from 0 to 25 students, inclusive. No student will sit at a desk unless either all other desks in its row or all others in its column are filled (or both). Considering only the set of desks that are occupied (and not which student sits at each desk), how many possible arrangements are there?
