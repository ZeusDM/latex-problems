Suppose $f$ and $g$ are differentiable functions such that \[xg(f(x))f^\prime(g(x))g^\prime(x)=f(g(x))g^\prime(f(x))f^\prime(x)\] for all real   Moreover, $f$ is nonnegative and $g$ is positive.  Furthermore, \[\int_0^a f(g(x))dx=1-\dfrac{e^{-2a}}{2}\] for all reals   Given that  compute the value of
