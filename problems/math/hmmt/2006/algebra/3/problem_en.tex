The train schedule in Hummut is hopelessly unreliable. Train $A$ will enter Intersection $X$ from the west at a random time between $9:00$ am and $2:30$ pm; each moment in that interval is equally likely. Train $B$ will enter the same intersection from the north at a random time between $9:30$ am and $12:30$ pm, independent of Train  again, each moment in the interval is equally likely. If each train takes $45$ minutes to clear the intersection, what is the probability of a collision today?
