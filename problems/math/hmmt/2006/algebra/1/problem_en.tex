Larry can swim from Harvard to MIT (with the current of the Charles River) in $40$ minutes, or back (against the current) in $45$ minutes. How long does it take him to row from Harvard to MIT, if he rows the return trip in $15$ minutes? (Assume that the speed of the current and Larryâ€™s swimming and rowing speeds relative to the current are all constant.) Express your answer in the format mm:ss.
