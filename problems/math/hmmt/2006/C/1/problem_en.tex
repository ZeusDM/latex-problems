Vernonia High School has $85$ seniors, each of whom plays on at least one of the school's three varsity sports teams: football, baseball, and lacrosse. It so happens that $74$ are on the football team; $26$ are on the baseball team; $17$ are on both the football and lacrosse teams; $18$ are on both the baseball and football teams; and $13$ are on both the baseball and lacrosse teams. Compute the number of seniors playing all three sports, given that twice this number are members of the lacrosse team.
