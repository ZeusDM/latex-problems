Somewhere in the universe, $n$ students are taking a $10$-question math competition. Their collective performance is called \emph{laughable} if, for some pair of questions, there exist $57$ students such that either all of them answered both questions correctly or none of them answered both questions correctly. Compute the smallest $n$ such that the performance is necessarily laughable.
