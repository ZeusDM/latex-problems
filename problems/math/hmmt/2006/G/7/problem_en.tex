Suppose $ABCD$ is an isosceles trapezoid in which $\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{CD}$. Two mutually externally tangent circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are inscribed in $ABCD$ such that $\omega_1$ is tangent to $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{BC}$, and $\overline{CD}$ while $\omega_2$ is tangent to $\overline{AB}$, $\overline{DA}$, and $\overline{CD}$. Given that $AB=1$, $CD=6$, compute the radius of either circle.
