Fifteen freshmen are sitting in a circle around a table, but the course assistant (who remains standing) has made only six copies of today’s handout. No freshman should get more than one handout, and any freshman who does not get one should be able to read a neighbor’s. If the freshmen are distinguishable but the handouts are not, how many ways are there to distribute the six handouts subject to the above conditions?
