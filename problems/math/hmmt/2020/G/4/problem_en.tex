Let $ABCD$ be a rectangle and $E$ be a point on segment $AD$. We are given that quadrilateral $BCDE$ has an inscribed circle $\omega_1$ that is tangent to $BE$ at $T$. If the incircle $\omega_2$ of $ABE$ is also tangent to $BE$ at $T$,  then find the ratio of the radius of $\omega_1$ to the radius of $\omega_2$.
