Circles $\omega_a, \omega_b, \omega_c$ have centers $A, B, C$, respectively and are pairwise externally tangent at points $D, E, F$ (with $D\in BC, E\in CA, F\in AB$). Lines $BE$ and $CF$ meet at $T$. Given that $\omega_a$ has radius $341$, there exists a line $\ell$ tangent to all three circles, and there exists a circle of radius $49$ tangent to all three circles, compute the distance from $T$ to $\ell$.
