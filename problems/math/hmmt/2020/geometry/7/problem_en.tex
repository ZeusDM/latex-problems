Let $\Gamma$ be a circle, and $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ be two non-intersecting circles inside $\Gamma$ that are internally tangent to $\Gamma$ at $X_1$ and $X_2$, respectively. Let one of the common internal tangents of $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ touch $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ at $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively, while intersecting $\Gamma$ at two points $A$ and $B$. Given that $2X_1T_1=X_2T_2$ and that $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$, and $\Gamma$ have radii $2$, $3$, and $12$, respectively, compute the length of $AB$.
