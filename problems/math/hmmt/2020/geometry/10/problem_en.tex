Let $\Gamma$ be a circle of radius $1$ centered at $O$. A circle $\Omega$ is said to be \emph{friendly} if there exist distinct circles $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$, $\ldots$, $\omega_{2020}$, such that for all $1\le i\le2020$, $\omega_i$ is tangent to $\Gamma$, $\Omega$, and $\omega_{i+1}$. (Here, $\omega_{2021} = \omega_1$.) For each point $P$ in the plane, let $f(P)$ denote the sum of the areas of all friendly circles centered at $P$. If $A$ and $B$ are points such that $OA=\frac12$ and $OB=\frac13$, determine $f(A)-f(B)$.
