For positive integers $n$ and $k$, let $\mho(n,k)$ be the number of distinct prime divisors of $n$ that are at least $k$. For example, $\mho(90, 3)=2$, since the only prime factors of $90$ that are at least $3$ are $3$ and $5$. Find the closest integer to
\[\sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{\mho(n,k)}{3^{n+k-7}}.\]
