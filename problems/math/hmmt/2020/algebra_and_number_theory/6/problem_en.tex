A polynomial $P(x)$ is a \emph{base-$n$ polynomial} if it is of the form $a_dx^d+a_{d-1}x^{d-1}+\cdots + a_1x+a_0$, where each $a_i$ is an integer between $0$ and $n-1$ inclusive and $a_d>0$. Find the largest positive integer $n$ such that for any real number $c$, there exists at most one base-$n$ polynomial $P(x)$ for which $P(\sqrt 2+\sqrt 3)=c$.
