Anne-Marie has a deck of $16$ cards, each with a distinct positive factor of $2002$ written on it. She shuffles the deck and begins to draw cards from the deck without replacement. She stops when there exists a nonempty subset of the cards in her hand whose numbers multiply to a perfect square. What is the expected number of cards in her hand when she stops?
