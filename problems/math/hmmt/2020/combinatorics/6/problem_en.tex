Alice writes $1001$ letters on a blackboard, each one chosen independently and uniformly at random from the set $S=\{a, b, c\}$. A move consists of erasing two distinct letters from the board and replacing them with the third letter in $S$. What is the probability that Alice can perform a sequence of moves which results in one letter remaining on the blackboard?
