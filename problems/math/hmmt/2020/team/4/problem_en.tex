Alan draws a convex $2020$-gon $\mathcal{A}=A_1A_2\dotsm A_{2020}$ with vertices in clockwise order and chooses $2020$ angles $\theta_1, \theta_2, \dotsc, \theta_{2020}\in (0, \pi)$ in radians with sum $1010\pi$. He then constructs isosceles triangles $\triangle A_iB_iA_{i+1}$ on the exterior of $\mathcal{A}$ with $B_iA_i=B_iA_{i+1}$ and $\angle A_iB_iA_{i+1}=\theta_i$. (Here, $A_{2021}=A_1$.) Finally, he erases $\mathcal{A}$ and the point $B_1$. He then tells Jason the angles $\theta_1, \theta_2, \dotsc, \theta_{2020}$ he chose. Show that Jason can determine where $B_1$ was from the remaining $2019$ points, i.e. show that $B_1$ is uniquely determined by the information Jason has.
