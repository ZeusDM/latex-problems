For $i=0,1,\dots,5$ let $l_i$ be the ray on the Cartesian plane starting at the origin, an angle $\theta=i\frac{\pi}{3}$ counterclockwise from the positive axis. For each  point $P_i$ is chosen uniformly at random from the intersection of $l_i$ with the unit disk. Consider the convex hull of the points  which will (with probability 1) be a convex polygon with $n$ vertices for some  What is the expected value of
