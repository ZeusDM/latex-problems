Nine pairwise noncongruent circles are drawn in the plane such that any two circles intersect twice. For each pair of circles, we draw the line through these two points, for a total of $\binom 92 = 36$ lines. Assume that all $36$ lines drawn are distinct. What is the maximum possible number of points which lie on at least two of the drawn lines?
