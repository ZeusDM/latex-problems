Victor has a drawer with two red socks,
two green socks,
two blue socks,
two magenta socks,
two lavender socks,
two neon socks,
two mauve socks,
two wisteria socks,
and $2000$ copper socks,
for a total of $2016$ socks.
He repeatedly draws two socks at a time from the drawer at random, and stops if the socks are of the same color. However, Victor is red-green colorblind, so he also stops if he sees a red and green sock.

What is the probability that Victor stops with two socks of the same color? Assume Victor returns both socks to the drawer at each step.
