Let $\Delta A_1B_1C$ be a triangle with $\angle A_1B_1C = 90^{\circ}$ and  For any  define $A_i$ to be the point on the line $A_1C$ such that $A_iB_{i-1} \perp A_1C$ and define $B_i$ to be the point on the line $B_1C$ such that  Let $\Gamma_1$ be the incircle of $\Delta A_1B_1C$ and for  $\Gamma_i$ be the circle tangent to $\Gamma_{i-1}, A_1C, B_1C$ which is smaller than 

How many integers $k$ are there such that the line $A_1B_{2016}$ intersects
