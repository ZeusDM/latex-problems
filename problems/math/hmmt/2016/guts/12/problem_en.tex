Let $R$ be the rectangle in the Cartesian plane with vertices at $(0,0), (2,0), (2,1),$ and  $R$ can be divided into two unit squares, as shown; the resulting figure has seven edges.

Compute the number of ways to choose one or more of the seven edges such that the resulting figure is traceable without lifting a pencil. (Rotations and reflections are considered distinct.)
