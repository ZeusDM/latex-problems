$\textbf{(Self-Isogonal Cubics)}$ Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB = 2$, $AC = 3$, $BC = 4$. The $\emph{isogonal conjugate}$ of a point $P$, denoted $P^\ast$, is the point obtained by intersecting the reflection of lines $PA$, $PB$, $PC$ across the angle bisectors of $\angle A$, $\angle B$, and $\angle C$, respectively.

Given a point $Q$, let $\mathfrak K(Q)$ denote the unique cubic plane curve which passes through all points $P$ such that line $PP^\ast$ contains $Q$.  Consider:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the M'Cay cubic $\mathfrak K(O)$,
where $O$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$,
	\item the Thomson cubic $\mathfrak K(G)$,
where $G$ is the centroid of $\triangle ABC$,
	\item the Napoleon-Feurerbach cubic $\mathfrak K(N)$,
where $N$ is the nine-point center of $\triangle ABC$,
	\item the Darboux cubic $\mathfrak K(L)$,
where $L$ is the de Longchamps point
(the reflection of the orthocenter across point $O$),
	\item the Neuberg cubic $\mathfrak K(X_{30})$,
where $X_{30}$ is the point at infinity along line $OG$,
	\item the nine-point circle of $\triangle ABC$,
	\item the incircle of $\triangle ABC$, and
	\item the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$.
\end{itemize}
Estimate $N$, the number of points lying on at least two of these eight curves. An estimate of $E$ earns $\left\lfloor 20 \cdot 2^{-|N-E|/6} \right\rfloor$ points.
