Alice and Bob play a game on a circle with 8 marked points. Alice places an apple beneath one of the points, then picks five of the other seven points and reveals that none of them are hiding the apple. Bob then drops a bomb on any of the points, and destroys the apple if he drops the bomb either on the point containing the apple or on an adjacent point. Bob wins if he destroys the apple, and Alice wins if he fails.  If both players play optimally, what is the probability that Bob destroys the apple?
