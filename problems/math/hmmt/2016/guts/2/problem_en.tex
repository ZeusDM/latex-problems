Sherry is waiting for a train. Every minute, there is a $75\%$ chance that a train will arrive.
However, she is engrossed in her game of sudoku, so even if a train arrives she has a $75\%$ chance of not noticing it (and hence missing the train).
What is the probability that Sherry catches the train in the next five minutes?
