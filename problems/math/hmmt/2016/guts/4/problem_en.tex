Consider a three-person game involving the following three types of fair six-sided dice.
\begin{itemize}
\item Dice of type $A$ have faces labelled      
\item Dice of type $B$ have faces labelled      
\item Dice of type $C$ have faces labelled      
\end{itemize}
All three players simultaneously choose a die (more than one person can choose the same type of die, and the players don't know one another's choices) and roll it.  Then the score of a player $P$ is the number of players whose roll is less than s roll (and hence is either   or .
Assuming all three players play optimally, what is the expected score of a particular player?
