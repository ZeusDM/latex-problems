Among citizens of Cambridge there exist $8$ different types of blood antigens. In a crowded lecture hall are $256$ students, each of whom has a blood type corresponding to a distinct subset of the antigens; the remaining of the antigens are foreign to them.

Quito the Mosquito flies around the lecture hall, picks a subset of the students uniformly at random,
and bites the chosen students in a random order. After biting a student, Quito stores a bit of any antigens that student had. A student bitten while Quito had $k$ blood antigen foreign to him/her will suffer for $k$ hours. What is the expected total suffering of all $256$ students, in hours?
