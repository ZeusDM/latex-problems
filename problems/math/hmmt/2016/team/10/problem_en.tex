Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incenter $I$ whose incircle is tangent to   $\overline{AB}$ at    Point $P$ lies on $\overline{EF}$ such that  Ray $BP$ meets $\overline{AC}$ at $Y$ and ray $CP$ meets $\overline{AB}$ at  Point $Q$ is selected on the circumcircle of $\triangle AYZ$ so that 

Prove that   $Q$ are collinear.
