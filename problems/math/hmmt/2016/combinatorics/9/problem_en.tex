Let  How many permutations $\sigma : V \to V$ are automorphisms of some tree?

(A $\emph{graph}$ consists of some set of vertices and some edges between pairs of distinct vertices.
It is $\emph{connected}$ if every two vertices in it are connected by some path of one or more edges.
A $\emph{tree}$ $G$ on $V$ is a connected graph with vertex set $V$ and exactly $|V|-1$ edges,
and an $\emph{automorphism}$ of $G$ is a permutation $\sigma : V \to V$ such that
vertices $i,j \in V$ are connected by an edge if and only if $\sigma(i)$ and $\sigma(j)$ are.)
