For positive integers  let $S_n$ be the set of integers $x$ such that $n$ distinct lines, no three concurrent, can divide a plane into $x$ regions (for example,  because the plane is divided into 3 regions if the two lines are parallel, and 4 regions otherwise). What is the minimum $i$ such that $S_i$ contains at least 4 elements?
