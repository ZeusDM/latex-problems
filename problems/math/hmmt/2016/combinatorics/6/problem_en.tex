Define the sequence $a_1, a_2 \dots$ as follows: $a_1=1$ and for every 
\[
a_n = \begin{cases}
n-2 & \text{if } a_{n-1} =0 \\
a_{n-1} -1 & \text{if } a_{n-1} \neq 0
\end{cases}
\]A non-negative integer $d$ is said to be {\em jet-lagged} if there are non-negative integers $r,s$ and a positive integer $n$ such that $d=r+s$ and that  How many  integers in $\{1,2,\dots, 2016\}$ are jet-lagged?
