Let $ ABC$ be an equilateral triangle with side length 2, and let $ \Gamma$ be a circle with radius $ \frac {1}{2}$ centered at the center of the equilateral triangle. Determine the length of the shortest path that starts somewhere on  visits all three sides of  and ends somewhere on $ \Gamma$ (not necessarily at the starting point). Express your answer in the form of  where $ p$ and $ q$ are rational numbers written as reduced fractions.
