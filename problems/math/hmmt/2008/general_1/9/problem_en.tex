A Sudoku matrix is deÔ¨Åned as a $ 9\times9$ array with entries from $ \{1, 2, \ldots , 9\}$ and with the constraint that each row, each column, and each of the nine $ 3 \times 3$ boxes that tile the array contains each digit from $ 1$ to $ 9$ exactly once. A Sudoku matrix is chosen at random (so that every Sudoku matrix has equal probability of being chosen). We know two of the squares in this matrix, as shown. What is the probability that the square marked by ? contains the digit
