Let $ \mathcal P$ be a parabola, and let $ V_1$ and $ F_1$ be its vertex and focus, respectively. Let $ A$ and $ B$ be points on $ \mathcal P$ so that  Let $ \mathcal Q$ be the locus of the midpoint of  It turns out that $ \mathcal Q$ is also a parabola, and let $ V_2$ and $ F_2$ denote its vertex and focus, respectively. Determine the ratio
