Let $ \mathcal{C}$ be the hyperbola   Given a point $ P_0$ on the axis, we construct a sequence of points $ (P_n)$ on the axis in the following manner: let $ \ell_n$ be the line with slope $ 1$ passing passing through  then $ P_{n+1}$ is the orthogonal projection of the point of intersection of $ \ell_n$ and $ \mathcal C$ onto the axis. (If  then the sequence simply terminates.)

Let $ N$ be the number of starting positions $ P_0$ on the axis such that  Determine the remainder of $ N$ when divided by
