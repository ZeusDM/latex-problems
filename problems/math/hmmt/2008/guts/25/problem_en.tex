Alice and the Cheshire Cat play a game. At each step, Alice either (1) gives the cat a penny, which causes the cat to change the number of (magic) beans that Alice has from $ n$ to $ 5n$ or (2) gives the cat a nickel, which causes the cat to give Alice another bean. Alice wins (and the cat disappears) as soon as the number of beans Alice has is greater than $ 2008$ and has last two digits  What is the minimum number of cents Alice can spend to win the game, assuming she starts with 0 beans?
