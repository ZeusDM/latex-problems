Suppose we have an (infinite) cone $ \mathcal C$ with apex $ A$ and a plane  The intersection of $ \pi$ and $ \mathcal C$ is an ellipse $ \mathcal E$ with major axis  such that $ B$ is closer to $ A$ than  and    Suppose we inscribe a sphere in each part of $ \mathcal C$ cut up by $ \mathcal E$ with both spheres tangent to  What is the ratio of the radii of the spheres (smaller to larger)?
