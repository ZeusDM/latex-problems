Two mathematicians, Kelly and Jason, play a cooperative game. The computer selects some secret positive integer $ n < 60$ (both Kelly and Jason know that  but that they don't know what the value of $ n$ is). The computer tells Kelly the unit digit of  and it tells Jason the number of divisors of  Then, Kelly and Jason have the following dialogue:

Kelly: I don't know what $ n$ is, and I'm sure that you don't know either. However, I know that $ n$ is divisible by at least two different primes.

Jason: Oh, then I know what the value of $ n$ is.

Kelly: Now I also know what $ n$ is.

Assuming that both Kelly and Jason speak truthfully and to the best of their knowledge, what are all the possible values of
