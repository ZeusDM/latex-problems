A piece of paper is folded in half.  A second fold is made at an angle $ \phi$  to the first, and a cut is made as shown below.

When the piece of paper is unfolded, the resulting hole is a polygon.  Let $ O$ be one of its vertices. Suppose that all the other vertices of the hole lie on a circle centered at  and also that  where $ X$ and $ Y$ are the the vertices of the hole adjacent to  Find the value(s) of $ \phi$ (in degrees).
