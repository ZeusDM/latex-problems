Kermit the frog enjoys hopping around the inÔ¨Ånite square grid in his backyard. It takes him $ 1$ Joule of energy to hop one step north or one step south, and $ 1$ Joule of energy to hop one step east or one step west. He wakes up one morning on the grid with $ 100$ Joules of energy, and hops till he falls asleep with $ 0$ energy. How many different places could he have gone to sleep?
