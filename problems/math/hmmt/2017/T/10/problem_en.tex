Let $LBC$ be a fixed triangle with $LB=LC$, and let $A$ be a variable point on arc $LB$ of its circumcircle. Let $I$ be the incenter of $\triangle{ABC}$ and $\overline{AK}$ the altitude from $A$. The circumcircle of $\triangle{IKL}$ intersects lines $KA$ and $BC$ again at $U\neq K$ and $V\neq K$. Finally, let $T$ be the projection of $I$ onto line $UV$. Prove that the line through $T$ and the midpoint of $\overline{IK}$ passes through a fixed point as $A$ varies.
