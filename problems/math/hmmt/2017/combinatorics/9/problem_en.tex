Let $m$ be a positive integer, and let $T$ denote the set of all subsets of  Call a subset $S$ of $T$ \textit{good} if for all    where $\Delta$ denotes the symmetric difference (the symmetric difference of two sets is the set of elements that is in exactly one of the two sets). Find the largest possible integer $s$ such that there exists an integer $m$ and good set of size
