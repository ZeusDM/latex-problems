Let $LBC$ be a fixed triangle with  and let $A$ be a variable point on arc $LB$ of its circumcircle. Let $I$ be the incenter of $\triangle ABC$ and $\overline{AK}$ the altitude from  The circumcircle of $\triangle IKL$ intersects lines $KA$ and $BC$ again at $U \neq K$ and  Finally, let $T$ be the projection of $I$ onto line  Prove that the line through $T$ and the midpoint of $\overline{IK}$ passes through a fixed point as $A$ varies.
