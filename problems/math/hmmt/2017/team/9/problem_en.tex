Let $n$ be an odd positive integer greater than  and consider a regular gon $\mathcal{G}$ in the plane centered at the origin. Let a \textit{subpolygon} $\mathcal{G}'$ be a polygon with at least $3$ vertices whose vertex set is a subset of that of  Say $\mathcal{G}'$ is \textit{well-centered} if its centroid is the origin. Also, say $\mathcal{G}'$ is \textit{decomposable} if its vertex set can be written as the disjoint union of regular polygons with at least $3$ vertices. Show that all well-centered subpolygons are decomposable if and only if $n$ has at most two distinct prime divisors.
