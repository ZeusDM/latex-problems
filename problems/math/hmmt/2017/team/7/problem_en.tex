Let $p$ be a prime. A \textit{complete residue class modulo } is a set containing at least one element equivalent to $k \pmod{p}$ for all 
(a) Show that there exists an $n$ such that the h row of Pascal's triangle forms a complete residue class modulo 
(b) Show that there exists an $n \le p^2$ such that the h row of Pascal's triangle forms a complete residue class modulo
