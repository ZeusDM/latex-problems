Triangle $ABC$ has side lengths $AB=14$, $AC=13$, and $BC=15$. Point $D$ is chosen in the interior of $\overline{AB}$ and point $E$ is selected uniformly at random from $\overline{AD}$. Point $F$ is then defined to be the intersection point of the perpendicular to $\overline{AB}$ at $E$ and the union of segments $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BC}$. Suppose that $D$ is chosen such that the expected value of the length of $\overline{EF}$ is maximized. Find $AD$.
