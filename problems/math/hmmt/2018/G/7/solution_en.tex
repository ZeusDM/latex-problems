Let $C'$ be the foot from $C$ onto $AB$. Observe that $CC'=12$, $AC'=5$, and $BC'=9$. Clearly, the optimal point $D$ must be between $B$ and $C'$ because sliding $D$ from $A$ to $B$ has larger $EF$ when $D$ is slightly past $C'$ than the average for up to $C'$. Observe that the optimal point $D$ is such that the average value of $EF$ is equal to $DK$, where $K$ is the point where $F$ would be if $E$ is $D$. This is because a $D$ slightly closer to $A$ would have a lower average but higher $DK$, which means we can improve, and a $D$ slightly closer to $B$ would have a higher average than $DK$, which means that we have been decreasing our average. Thus, $DK$ is the average value of $EF$. But $AD$ times the average value of $EF$ is the area of $ADKC$, so we just want $AD\cdot DK=\left[ADKC\right]$.
