Suppose $(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4)$ is a 4-term sequence of real numbers satisfying the following two conditions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $a_3=a_2+a_1$ and 
	\item there exist real numbers $a,b,c$ such that \[an^2+bn+c=\cos(a_n)\] for all 
\end{itemize}
Compute the maximum possible value of \[\cos(a_1)-\cos(a_4)\] over all such sequences
