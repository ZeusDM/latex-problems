Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral with     Let lines perpendicular to $\overline{BC}$ from $B$ and $C$ meet $\overline{AD}$ at $B'$ and  respectively. Let lines perpendicular to $\overline{BC}$ from $A$ and $D$ meet $\overline{AD}$ at $A'$ and  respectively. Compute the ratio  where $[\overline{\omega}]$ denotes the area of figure
