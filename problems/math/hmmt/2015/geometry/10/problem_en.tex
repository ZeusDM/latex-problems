Let $\mathcal{G}$ be the set of all points $(x,y)$ in the Cartesian plane such that $0\le y\le 8$ and $$(x-3)^2+31=(y-4)^2+8\sqrt{y(8-y)}.$$There exists a unique line $\ell$ of \textit{negative slope} tangent to $\mathcal{G}$ and passing through the point  Suppose $\ell$ is tangent to $\mathcal{G}$ at a \textit{unique} point  Find the coordinates $(\alpha, \beta)$ of
