A \textit{kite} is a quadrilateral whose diagonals are perpendicular.  Let kite $ABCD$ be such that   Let $M$ and $N$ be the points of tangency of the incircle of $ABCD$ to $AB$ and $BC$ respectively.  Let $\omega$ be the circle centered at $C$ and tangent to $AB$ and   Construct another kite $AB^\prime C^\prime D^\prime$ that is similar to $ABCD$ and whose incircle is   Let $N^\prime$ be the point of tangency of $B^\prime C^\prime$ to   If  then what is the ratio of
