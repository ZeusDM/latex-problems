Suppose you are given a fair coin and a sheet of paper with the polynomial $x^m$ written on it. Now for each toss of the coin, if heads show up, you must erase the polynomial $x^r$ (where $r$ is going to change with time - initially it is  written on the paper and replace it with  If tails show up, replace it with  What is the expected value of the polynomial I get after $m$ such tosses? (Note: this is a different concept from the most probable value)
