Box A contains $3$ black and $4$ blue marbles. Box B has $7$ black and $1$ blue, whereas Box C has $2$ black, $3$ blue and $1$ green marble. I close my eyes and pick two marbles from $2$ different boxes. If it turns out that I get $1$ black and $1$ blue marble, what is the probability that the black marble is from box A and the blue one is from C?
