I call two people $A$ and $B$ and think of a natural number   Then I give the number $n$ to $A$ and the number $n+1$ to   I tell them that they have both been given natural numbers, and further that they are consecutive natural numbers.  However, I don't tell $A$ what s number is and vice versa.  I start by asing $A$ if he knows s number.  He says "no",  Then I ask $B$ if he knows s number, and he says "no" too.  I go back to $A$ and ask, and so on.  $A$ and $B$ can both hear each other's responses.  Do I ever get a "yes" in response?  If so, who responds first with "yes" and how many times does he say "no" before this?  Assume that both $A$ and $B$ are very intelligent and logical.  You may need to consider multiple cases.
