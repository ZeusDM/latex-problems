Barbara, Edward, Abhinav, and Alex took turns writing this test. Working alone, they could finish it in    and $12$ days, respectively. If only one person works on the test per day, and nobody works on it unless everyone else has spent at least as many days working on it, how many days (an integer) did it take to write this test?
