Let $O$ be the circumcentre of a triangle $ABC$ such that $\angle BAC \neq 90^\circ$ and let $\gamma$
be the circumcircle of $BOC$ and $\Omega$ its centre. If $P$ is a point of the side $BC$, let $Q$ denote the point of intersection other than $O$ of the line $OP$ and $\gamma$. Let $M$ be the intersection of $OA$ and $\Omega Q$. Prove that $MA = MQ$ if, and only if, $AP$ is the angle bisector of $\angle BAC$.
