Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle BAC = 90^\circ$ and let $\Gamma$ be the circle with centre $B$
and radius $BC$. A circle $\gamma$ passing through $B$ and $A$ intersects $\Gamma$ at $X$, $Y$ with
$X \neq Y$. Let $E$ and $F$ be the orthogonal projections of $X$ and $Y$ onto $CY$ and
$CX$, respectively. Prove that the line $CA$ bisects $EF$.
