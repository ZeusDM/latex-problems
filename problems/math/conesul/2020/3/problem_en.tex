Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle such that $AC<BC$ and $\omega$ its circumcircle. $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$. Points $F$ and $E$ are chosen in $AB$ and $BC$, respectively, such that $AC=CF$ and $EB=EF$. The line $AM$ intersects $\omega$ in $D\neq A$. The line $DE$ intersects the line $FM$ in $G$. Prove that $G$ lies on $\omega$.
