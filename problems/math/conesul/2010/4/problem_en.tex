Pablo and Silvia play a game on a $2010\times{2010}$ board. First Pablo fills in each cell with an integer. Then Silvia repeats the following operation as many times as she likes: she picks three cells that form an L, like in the figure, and adds 1 to each number in the three cells. Silvia wins if she makes all of the number multiples of $10$.
