The incircle of triangle $ABC$ touches sides $BC$,  $AC$,  and $AB$ at $D, E$,  and $F$ respectively. Let $\omega_a, \omega_b$ and $\omega_c$ be the circumcircles of triangles $EAF, DBF$,  and $DCE$,  respectively. The lines $DE$ and $DF$ cut $\omega_a$ at $E_a\neq{E}$ and $F_a\neq{F}$,  respectively. Let $r_A$ be the line $E_{a}F_a$. Let $r_B$ and $r_C$ be defined analogously. Show that the lines $r_A$,  $r_B$,  and $r_C$ determine a triangle with its vertices on the sides of triangle $ABC$.
