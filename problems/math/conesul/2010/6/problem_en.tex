Determine if there exists an infinite sequence $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3,...$ of nonegative integers that satisfies the following conditions:

(i)	All nonegative integers appear in the sequence exactly once.

(ii)	The succession$b_n=a_{n}+n,$,  $n\geq0$, 

is formed by all prime numbers and each one appears exactly once.
