Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\omega$, incenter $I$, and $A$-excenter $I_A$. Let the incircle and the $A$-excircle hit $BC$ at $D$ and $E$, respectively, and let $M$ be the midpoint of arc $BC$ without $A$. Consider the circle tangent to $BC$ at $D$ and arc $BAC$ at $T$. If $TI$ intersects $\omega$ again at $S$, prove that $SI_A$ and $ME$ meet on $\omega$.
