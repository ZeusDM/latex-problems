$2010$ MOPpers are assigned numbers $1$ through $2010$. Each one is given a red slip and a blue slip of paper. Two positive integers, $A$ and $B$, each less than or equal to $2010$ are chosen. On the red slip of paper, each MOPper writes the remainder when the product of $A$ and his or her number is divided by $2011$. On the blue slip of paper, he or she writes the remainder when the product of $B$ and his or her number is divided by $2011$. The MOPpers may then perform either of the following two operations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each MOPper gives his or her red slip to the MOPper whose number is written on his or her blue slip.
	\item Each MOPper gives his or her blue slip to the MOPper whose number is written on his or her red slip.
\end{itemize}
Show that it is always possible to perform some number of these operations such that each MOPper is holding a red slip with his or her number written on it.
