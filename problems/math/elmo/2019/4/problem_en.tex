Carl is given three distinct non-parallel lines $\ell_1, \ell_2, \ell_3$ and a circle $\omega$ in the plane. In addition to a normal straightedge, Carl has a special straightedge which, given a line $\ell$ and a point $P$, constructs a new line passing through $P$ parallel to $\ell$. (Carl does not have a compass.) Show that Carl can construct a triangle with circumcircle $\omega$ whose sides are parallel to $\ell_1,\ell_2,\ell_3$ in some order.
