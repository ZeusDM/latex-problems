The edges of $K_{2017}$ are each labeled with $1$, $2$, or $3$ such that any triangle has sum of labels at least $5$. Determine the minimum possible average of all $\binom{2017}{2}$ labels.
 
(Here $K_{2017}$ is defined as the complete graph on $2017$ vertices, with an edge between every pair of vertices.)
