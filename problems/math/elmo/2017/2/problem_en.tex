Let $ABC$ be a triangle with orthocenter $H$, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$. Suppose that $P$ and $Q$ are distinct points on the circle with diameter $\overline{AH}$, different from $A$, such that $M$ lies on line $PQ$. Prove that the orthocenter of $\triangle{APQ}$ lies on the circumcircle of $\triangle{ABC}$.
