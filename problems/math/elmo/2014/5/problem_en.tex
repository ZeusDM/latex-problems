Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcenter $O$ and orthocenter $H$. Let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ denote the circumcircles of triangles $BOC$ and $BHC$, respectively. Suppose the circle with diameter $\overline{AO}$ intersects $\omega_1$ again at $M$, and line $AM$ intersects $\omega_1$ again at $X$. Similarly, suppose the circle with diameter $\overline{AH}$ intersects $\omega_2$ again at $N$, and line $AN$ intersects $\omega_2$ again at $Y$. Prove that lines $MN$ and $XY$ are parallel.
