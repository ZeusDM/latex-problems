Let $A$ be a point in the plane, and $\ell$ a line not passing through $A$. Evan does not have a straightedge, but instead has a special compass which has the ability to draw a circle through three distinct noncollinear points. (The center of the circle is \emph{not} marked in this process.) Additionally, Evan can mark the intersections between two objects drawn, and can mark an arbitrary point on a given object or on the plane.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item Can Evan construct* the reflection of $A$ over $\ell$?
	\item Can Evan construct the foot of the altitude from $A$ to $\ell$?
\end{enumerate}
*To construct a point, Evan must have an algorithm which marks the point in finitely many steps.
