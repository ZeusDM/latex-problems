Let $n$ be a positive integer. There are $2018n+1$ cities in the Kingdom of Sellke Arabia. King Mark wants to build two-way roads that connect certain pairs of cities such that for each city $C$ and integer $1\le i\le 2018,$ there are exactly $n$ cities that are a distance $i$ away from $C.$ (The \emph{distance} between two cities is the least number of roads on any path between the two cities.)
    
For which $n$ is it possible for Mark to achieve this?
