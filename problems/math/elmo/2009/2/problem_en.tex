Let $ABC$ be a triangle such that $AB < AC$. Let $P$ lie on a line through $A$ parallel to line $BC$ such that $C$ and $P$ are on the same side of line $AB$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of segment $BC$.  Define $D$ on segment $BC$ such that $\angle BAD = \angle CAM$, and define $T$ on the extension of ray $CB$ beyond $B$ so that $\angle BAT = \angle CAP$.  Given that lines $PC$ and $AD$ intersect at $Q$, that lines $PD$ and $AB$ intersect at $R$, and that $S$ is the midpoint of segment $DT$, prove that if $A$,$P$,$Q$, and $R$ lie on a circle, then $Q$, $R$, and $S$ are collinear.
