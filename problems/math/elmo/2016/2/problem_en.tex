Oscar is drawing diagrams with trash can lids and sticks. He draws a triangle $ABC$ and a point $D$ such that $DB$ and $DC$ are tangent to the circumcircle of $ABC$. Let $B'$ be the reflection of $B$ over $AC$ and $C'$ be the reflection of $C$ over $AB$. If $O$ is the circumcenter of $DB'C'$, help Oscar prove that $AO$ is perpendicular to $BC$.
