Elmo is now learning olympiad geometry. In triangle $ABC$ with $AB\neq AC$, let its incircle be tangent to sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ at $D$, $E$, and $F$, respectively. The internal angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ intersects lines $DE$ and $DF$ at $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Let $S$ and $T$ be distinct points on side $BC$ such that $\angle XSY=\angle XTY=90^\circ$. Finally, let $\gamma$ be the circumcircle of $\triangle AST$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Help Elmo show that $\gamma$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$.
	\item Help Elmo show that $\gamma$ is tangent to the incircle of $\triangle ABC$.
\end{enumerate}
