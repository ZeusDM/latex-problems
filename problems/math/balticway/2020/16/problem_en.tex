Richard and Kaarel are taking turns to choose numbers from the
set $\{1,\dots,p-1\}$ where $p > 3$ is a prime. Richard is the first one to
choose. A number which has been chosen by one of the players cannot
be chosen again by either of the players. Every number chosen by Richard is multiplied
with the next number chosen by Kaarel. Kaarel wins the game if at any moment after his turn the sum of all of the products calculated so far is divisible by $p$.
Richard wins if this does not happen, i.e. the players run out of numbers before
any of the sums is divisible by $p$. Can either of the players guarantee their
victory regardless of their opponent's moves and if so, which one?
