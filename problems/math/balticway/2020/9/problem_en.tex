Each vertex $v$ and each edge $e$ of a graph $G$ are assigned numbers $f(v)\in\{1,2\}$ and $f(e)\in\{1,2,3\}$, respectively.
Let $S(v)$ be the sum of numbers assigned to the edges incident to $v$ plus the number $f(v)$.
We say that an assignment $f$ is \emph{cool} if  $S(u) \ne S(v)$ for every pair $(u,v)$ of adjacent (i.e. connected by an edge) vertices in $G$.
Prove that for every graph there exists a cool assignment.
