Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with circumcircle $\omega$. Let $\ell$ be the tangent line to $\omega$ at $A$. Let $X$ and $Y$ be the projections of $B$ onto lines $\ell$ and $AC$, respectively. Let $H$ be the orthocenter of $BXY$. Let $CH$ intersect $\ell$ at $D$. Prove that $BA$ bisects angle $CBD$.
