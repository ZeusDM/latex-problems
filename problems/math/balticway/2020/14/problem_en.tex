An acute triangle $ABC$ is given and let $H$ be its orthocenter. Let $\omega$ be the circle through $B$, $C$ and $H$, and let $\Gamma$ be the circle with diameter $AH$. Let $X\neq H$ be the other intersection point of $\omega$ and $\Gamma$, and let $\gamma$ be the reflection of $\Gamma$ over $AX$.

Suppose $\gamma$ and $\omega$ intersect again at $Y\neq X$, and line $AH$ and $\omega$ intersect again at $Z \neq H$. Show that the circle through $A,Y,Z$ passes through the midpoint of segment $BC$.
