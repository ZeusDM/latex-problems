A rectangular array has $ n$ rows and $ 6$ columns, where $ n \geq 2$. In each cell there is written either $ 0$ or $ 1$. All rows in the array are different from each other. For each two rows $ (x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},x_{4},x_{5},x_{6})$ and $ (y_{1},y_{2},y_{3},y_{4},y_{5},y_{6})$,  the row $ (x_{1}y_{1},x_{2}y_{2},x_{3}y_{3},x_{4}y_{4},x_{5}y_{5},x_{6}y_{6})$ can be found in the array as well. Prove that there is a column in which at least half of the entries are zeros.
