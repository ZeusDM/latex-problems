Let $N$ and $K$ be positive integers satisfying $1 \leq K \leq N$. A deck of $N$ different playing cards is shuffled by repeating the operation of reversing the order of $K$ topmost cards and moving these to the bottom of the deck. Prove that the deck will be back in its initial order after a number of operations not greater than $(2N/K)^2$.
