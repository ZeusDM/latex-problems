Let the lines $e$ and $f$ be perpendicular and intersect each other at $H$. Let $A$ and $B$ lie on $e$ and $C$ and $D$ lie on $f$,  such that all five points $A,B,C,D$ and $H$ are distinct. Let the lines $b$ and $d$ pass through $B$ and $D$ respectively, perpendicularly to $AC$; let the lines $a$ and $c$ pass through $A$ and $C$ respectively, perpendicularly to $BD$. Let $a$ and $b$ intersect at $X$ and $c$ and $d$ intersect at $Y$. Prove that $XY$ passes through $H$.
