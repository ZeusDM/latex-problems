Let $a_0$ be a positive integer. Define the sequence $\{a_n\}_{n \geq 0}$ as follows: if \[ a_n = \sum_{i = 0}^jc_i10^i \] where $c_i \in \{0,1,2,\cdots,9\}$,  then \[ a_{n + 1} = c_0^{2005} + c_1^{2005} + \cdots + c_j^{2005}. \] Is it possible to choose $a_0$ such that all terms in the sequence are distinct?
