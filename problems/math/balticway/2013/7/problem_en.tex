A positive integer is written on a blackboard. Players $A$ and $B$ play the following game: in each move one has to choose a proper divisor $m$ of the number $n$ written on the blackboard ($1<m<n$) and replaces $n$ with $n-m$. Player $A$ makes the first move, then players move alternately. The player who can't make a move loses the game. For which starting numbers is there a winning strategy for player $B$?
