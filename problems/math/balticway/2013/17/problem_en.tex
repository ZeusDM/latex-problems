Let $c$ and $n > c$ be positive integers. Mary's teacher writes $n$ positive integers on a blackboard. Is it true that for all $n$ and $c$ Mary can always label the numbers written by the teacher by $a_1,\ldots, a_n$ in such an order that the cyclic product $(a_1-a_2)\cdot(a_2-a_3)\cdots(a_{n-1}-a_n)\cdot(a_n-a_1)$ would be congruent to either $0$ or $c$ modulo $n$?
