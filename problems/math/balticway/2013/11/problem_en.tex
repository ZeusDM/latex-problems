In an acute triangle $ABC$ with $AC > AB$,  let $D$ be the projection of $A$ on $BC$,  and let $E$ and $F$ be the projections of $D$ on $AB$ and $AC$,  respectively. Let $G$ be the intersection point of the lines $AD$ and $EF$. Let $H$ be the second intersection point of the line $AD$ and the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. Prove that \[AG \cdot AH=AD^2\]
