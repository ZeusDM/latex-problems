Circles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the same radius intersect in two points, one of which is $P$. Denote by $A$ and $B$,  respectively, the points diametrically opposite to $P$ on each of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. A third circle of the same radius passes through $P$ and intersects $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the points $X$ and $Y$ , respectively. Show that the line $XY$ is parallel to the line $AB$.
