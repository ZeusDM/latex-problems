Let $n$ be a positive integer. Assume that $n$ numbers are to be chosen from the table$\begin{array}{cccc}0 & 1 & \cdots & n-1\\ n & n+1 & \cdots & 2n-1\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\(n-1)n & (n-1)n+1 & \cdots & n^2-1\end{array} $

with no two of them from the same row or the same column. Find the maximal value of the product of these $n$ numbers.
