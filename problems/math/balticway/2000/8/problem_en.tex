Fourteen friends met at a party. One of them, Fredek, wanted to go to bed early. He said goodbye to 10 of his friends, forgot about the remaining 3, and went to bed. After a while he returned to the party, said goodbye to 10 of his friends (not necessarily the same as before), and went to bed. Later Fredek came back a number of times, each time saying goodbye to exactly 10 of his friends, and then went back to bed. As soon as he had said goodbye to each of his friends at least once, he did not come back again. In the morning Fredek realized that he had said goodbye a different number of times to each of his thirteen friends! What is the smallest possible number of times that Fredek returned to the party?
