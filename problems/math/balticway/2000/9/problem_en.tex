There is a frog jumping on a $ 2k \times 2k$ chessboard, composed of unit squares. The frog's jumps are $ \sqrt{1 + k^2}$ long and they carry the frog from the center of a square to the center of another square. Some $ m$ squares of the board are marked with an $ \times$,  and all the squares into which the frog can jump from an $ \times$'d square (whether they carry an $ \times$ or not) are marked with an $ \circ$. There are $ n$ $ \circ$'d squares. Prove that $ n \ge m$.
