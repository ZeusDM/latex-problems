Let $ K$ be a point inside the triangle $ ABC$. Let $ M$ and $ N$ be points such that $ M$ and $ K$ are on opposite sides of the line $ AB$,  and $ N$ and $ K$ are on opposite sides of the line $ BC$. Assume that $ \angle MAB = \angle MBA = \angle NBC = \angle NCB = \angle KAC = \angle KCA$. Show that $ MBNK$ is a parallelogram.
