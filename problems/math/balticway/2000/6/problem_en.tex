Fredek runs a private hotel. He claims that whenever $ n \ge 3$ guests visit the hotel, it is possible to select two guests that have equally many acquaintances among the other guests, and that also have a common acquaintance or a common unknown among the guests. For which values of $ n$ is Fredek right? (Acquaintance is a symmetric relation.)
