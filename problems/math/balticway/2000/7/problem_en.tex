In a $ 40 \times 50$ array of control buttons, each button has two states: on and off. By touching a button, its state and the states of all buttons in the same row and in the same column are switched. Prove that the array of control buttons may be altered from the all-off state to the all-on state by touching buttons successively, and determine the least number of touches needed to do so.
