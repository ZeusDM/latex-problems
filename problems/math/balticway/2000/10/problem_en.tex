Two positive integers are written on the blackboard. Initially, one of them is $2000$ and the other is smaller than $2000$. If the arithmetic mean $ m$ of the two numbers on the blackboard is an integer, the following operation is allowed: one of the two numbers is erased and replaced by $ m$. Prove that this operation cannot be performed more than ten times. Give an example where the operation is performed ten times.
