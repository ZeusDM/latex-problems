The squares of a squared paper are enumerated as shown on the picture.\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c}

\ddots &&&&&\\ \hline

10&\ddots&&&&\\ \hline

6&9&\ddots&&&\\ \hline

3&5&8&12&\ddots&\\ \hline

1&2&4&7&11&\ddots\\ \hline

\end{array}\]

Devise a polynomial $p(m, n)$ in two variables such that for any $m, n \in \mathbb{N}$ the number written in the square with coordinates $(m, n)$ is equal to $p(m, n)$.
