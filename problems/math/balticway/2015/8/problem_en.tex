With inspiration drawn from the rectilinear network of streets in New York , the Manhattan distance between two points $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ in the plane is defined to be \[|a-c|+|b-d|\]Suppose only two distinct Manhattan distance occur between all pairs of distinct points of some point set. What is the maximal number of points in such a set?
