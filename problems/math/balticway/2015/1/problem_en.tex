For $n\geq 2$ , an equilateral triangle is divided into $n^2$ congruent smaller equilateral triangles. Detemine all ways in which real numbers can be assigned to the $\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$ vertices so that three such numbers sum to zero whenever the three vertices form a triangle with edges parallel to the sides of the big triangle.
