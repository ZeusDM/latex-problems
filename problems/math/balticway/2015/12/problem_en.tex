A circle passes through vertex $B$ of the triangle $ABC$,  intersects its sides $ AB $and $BC$ at points $K$ and $L$,  respectively, and touches the side $ AC$ at its midpoint $M$. The point $N$ on the arc $BL$ (which does not contain $K$) is such that $\angle LKN = \angle ACB$. Find $\angle BAC $ given that the triangle $CKN$ is equilateral.
