A family wears clothes of three colors: red,blue and green,with a separate,identical laundry bin for each color. At the beginning of the first week,all bins are empty.Each week,the family generates a total of $10 kg $ of laundry(the proportion of each color is subject to variation).The laundry is sorted by color and placed in the bins.Next,the heaviest bin(only one of them,if there are several that are heaviest)is emptied and its content swashed.What is the minimal possible storing capacity required of the laundry bins in order for them never to overflow?
