In the non-isosceles triangle $ABC$ an altitude from $A$ meets side $BC$ in $D$ . Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$ and let $N$ be the reflection of $M$ in $D$ . The circumcirle of triangle $AMN$ intersects the side $AB$ in $P\ne A$ and the side $AC$ in $Q\ne A$ . Prove that $AN,BQ$ and $CP$ are concurrent.
