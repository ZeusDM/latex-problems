A subset $S$ of $ {1,2,...,n}$ is called balanced if for every $a $ from $S $ there exists some $ b $from $S$,  $b\neq a$,  such that $ \frac{(a+b)}{2}$  is in $S$ as well.

(a) Let $k > 1 $be an integer and let $n = 2k$. Show that every subset $ S$ of ${1,2,...,n} $ with $|S| > \frac{3n}{4}$  is balanced.

(b) Does there exist an $n =2k$,  with $ k > 1 $ an integer, for which every subset $ S$ of ${1,2,...,n} $ with $ |S| >\frac{2n}{3} $ is balanced?
