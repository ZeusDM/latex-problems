In triangle $ABC$,  the interior and exterior angle bisectors of $ \angle BAC$ intersect the line $BC$ in $D $ and $E$,  respectively. Let $F$ be the second point of intersection of the line $AD$ with the circumcircle of the triangle $ ABC$. Let $O$ be the circumcentre of the triangle $ ABC $and let $D'$ be the reflection of $D$ in $O$. Prove that $ \angle D'FE =90.$
