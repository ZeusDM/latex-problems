Assume that all angles of a triangle $ABC$ are acute. Let $D$ and $E$ be points on the sides $AC$ and $BC$ of the triangle such that $A, B, D,$ and $E$ lie on the same circle. Further suppose the circle through $D,E,$ and $C$ intersects the side $AB$ in two points $X$ and $Y$. Show that the midpoint of $XY$ is the foot of the altitude from $C$ to $AB$.
