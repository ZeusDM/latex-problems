Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with precisely one pair of parallel sides.$(a)$ Show that the lengths of its sides $AB,BC,CD, DA$ (in this order) do not form an arithmetic progression.$(b)$ Show that there is such a quadrilateral for which the lengths of its sides $AB ,BC,CD,DA$ form an arithmetic progression after the order of the lengths is changed.
