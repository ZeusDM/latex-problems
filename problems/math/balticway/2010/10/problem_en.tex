Let $n$ be an integer with $n\ge 3$. Consider all dissections of a convex $n$-gon into triangles by $n-3$ non-intersecting diagonals, and all colourings of the triangles with black and white so that triangles with a common side are always of a different colour. Find the least possible number of black triangles.
