An $n\times n$ board is coloured in $n$ colours such that the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) is coloured in the first colour; the two adjacent diagonals are coloured in the second colour; the two next diagonals (one from above and one from below) are coloured in the third colour, etc; the two corners (top-right and bottom-left) are coloured in the $n$-th colour. It happens that it is possible to place on the board $n$ rooks, no two attacking each other and such that no two rooks stand on cells of the same colour. Prove that $n=0\pmod{4}$ or $n=1\pmod{4}$.
