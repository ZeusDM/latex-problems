A castle has a number of halls and $n$ doors. Every door leads into another hall or outside. Every hall has at least two doors. A knight enters the castle. In any hall, he can choose any door for exit except the one he

just used to enter that hall. Find a strategy allowing the knight to get outside after visiting no more than $2n$ halls (a hall is counted each time it is entered).
