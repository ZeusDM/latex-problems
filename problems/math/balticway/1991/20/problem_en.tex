Consider two points $A(x_1, y_1)$ and $B(x_2, y_2)$ on the graph of the function $y = \frac{1}{x}$ such that $0 < x_1 < x_2$ and $AB = 2 \cdot OA$,  where $O = (0, 0)$. Let $C$ be the midpoint of the segment $AB$. Prove that the angle between the $x$-axis and the ray $OA$ is equal to three times the angle between the $x$-axis and the ray $OC$.
