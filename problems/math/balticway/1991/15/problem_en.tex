In each of the squares of a chessboard an arbitrary integer is written. A king starts to move on the board. Whenever the king moves to some square, the number in that square is increased by $1$. Is it always possible to make the numbers on the chessboard:

(a) all even;

(b) all divisible by $3$;

(c) all equal?
