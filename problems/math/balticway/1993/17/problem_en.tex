Let’s consider three pairwise non-parallel straight constant lines in the plane. Three points are moving along these lines with different nonzero velocities, one on each line (we consider the movement to have taken place for infinite time and continue infinitely in the future). Is it possible to determine these straight lines, the velocities of each moving point and their positions at some “zero” moment in such a way that the points never were, are or will be collinear?
