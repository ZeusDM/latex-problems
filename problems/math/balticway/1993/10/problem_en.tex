Let $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ and $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$ be two finite sequences consisting of $2n$ real different numbers. Rearranging each of the sequences in increasing order we obtain $a_1',a_2',\ldots,a_n'$ and $b_1',b_2',\ldots,b_n'$. Prove that\[\max_{1\le i\le n}|a_i-b_i|\ge\max_{1\le i\le n}|a_i'-b_i'|.\]
