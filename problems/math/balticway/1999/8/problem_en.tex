We are given $1999$ coins. No two coins have the same weight. A machine is provided which allows us with one operation to determine, for any three coins, which one has the middle weight. Prove that the coin that is the $1000$th by weight can be determined using no more than $1000000$ operations and that this is the only coin whose position by weight can be determined using this machine.
