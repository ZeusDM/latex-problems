Let $ABC$ be a triangle, let $B_{1}$ be the midpoint of the side $AB$ and $C_{1}$ the midpoint of the side $AC$. Let $P$ be the point of intersection, other than $A$,  of the circumscribed circles around the triangles $ABC_{1}$ and $AB_{1}C$. Let $P_{1}$ be the point of intersection, other than $A$,  of the line $AP$ with the circumscribed circle around the triangle $AB_{1}C_{1}$. Prove that $2AP=3AP_{1}$.
