Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $\angle BAC>\angle BCA$,  and let $D$ be a point on side $AC$ such that $|AB|=|BD|$. Furthermore, let $F$ be a point on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ such that line $FD$ is perpendicular to side $BC$ and points $F,B$ lie on different sides of line $AC$. Prove that line $FB$ is perpendicular to side $AC$.
