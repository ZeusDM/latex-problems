Two magicians show the following trick. The first magician goes out of the room. The second magician takes a deck of $100$ cards labelled by numbers $1,2,\ldots ,100$ and asks three spectators to choose in turn one card each. The second magician sees what card each spectator has taken. Then he adds one more card from the rest of the deck. Spectators shuffle these $4$ cards, call the first magician and give him these $4$ cards. The first magician looks at the $4$ cards and “guesses” what card was chosen by the first spectator, what card by the second and what card by the third. Prove that the magicians can perform this trick.
