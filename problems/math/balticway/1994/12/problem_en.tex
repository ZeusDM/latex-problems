The inscribed circle of the triangle $A_1A_2A_3$ touches the sides $A_2A_3,A_3A_1,A_1A_2$ at points $S_1,S_2,S_3$,  respectively. Let $O_1,O_2,O_3$ be the centres of the inscribed circles of triangles $A_1S_2S_3, A_2S_3S_1,A_3S_1S_2$,  respectively. Prove that the straight lines $O_1S_1,O_2S_2,O_3S_3$ intersect at one point.
