Let $NS$ and $EW$ be two perpendicular diameters of a circle $\mathcal{C}$. A line $\ell$ touches $\mathcal{C}$ at point $S$. Let $A$ and $B$ be two points on $\mathcal{C}$,  symmetric with respect to the diameter $EW$. Denote the intersection points of $\ell$ with the lines $NA$ and $NB$ by $A'$ and $B'$,  respectively. Show that $|SA'|\cdot |SB'|=|SN|^2$.
