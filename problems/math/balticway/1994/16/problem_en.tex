The Wonder Island is inhabited by Hedgehogs. Each Hedgehog consists of three segments of unit length having a common endpoint, with all three angles between them $120^{\circ}$. Given that all Hedgehogs are lying flat on the island and no two of them touch each other, prove that there is a finite number of Hedgehogs on Wonder Island.
