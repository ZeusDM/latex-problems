The Wonder Island Intelligence Service has $16$ spies in Tartu. Each of them watches on some of his colleagues. It is known that if spy $A$ watches on spy $B$,  then $B$ does not watch on $A$. Moreover, any $10$ spies can numbered in such a way that the first spy watches on the second, the second watches on the third and so on until the tenth watches on the first. Prove that any $11$ spies can also be numbered is a similar manner.
