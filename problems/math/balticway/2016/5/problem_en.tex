Let $p > 3$ be a prime such that $p\equiv  3 \pmod 4.$ Given a positive integer $a_0$ define the sequence $a_0, a_1, \ldots $ of integers by $a_n = a^{2^n}_{n-1}$ for all $n = 1, 2,\ldots.$ Prove that it is possible to choose $a_0$ such that the subsequence $a_N , a_{N+1}, a_{N+2}, \ldots $  is not constant modulo $p$ for any positive integer $N.$
