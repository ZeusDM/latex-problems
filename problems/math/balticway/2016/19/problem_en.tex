Consider triangles in the plane where each vertex has integer coordinates. Such a triangle can be legally transformed by moving one vertex parallel to the opposite side to a different point with integer coordinates. Show that if two triangles have the same area, then there exists a series of legal transformations that transforms one to the other.
