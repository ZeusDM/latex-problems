The set $\{1, 2, . . . , 10\}$ is partitioned to three subsets $A, B$ and $C.$ For each subset the sum of its elements, the product of its elements and the sum of the digits of all its elements are calculated.

Is it possible that $A$ alone has the largest sum of elements, $B$ alone has the largest product of elements, and $C$ alone has the largest sum of digits?
