A cube consists of $4^3$ unit cubes each containing an integer. At each move, you choose a unit cube and increase by $1$ all the integers in the neighbouring cubes having a face in common with the chosen cube. Is it possible to reach a position where all the $4^3$ integers are divisible by $3,$ no matter what the starting position is?
