A chess knight has injured his leg and is limping. He alternates between a normal move and a short move where he moves to any diagonally neighbouring cell.

The limping knight moves on a $5 \times 6$ cell chessboard starting with a normal move. What is the largest number of moves he can make if he is starting from a cell of his own choice and is not allowed to visit any cell (including the initial cell) more than once?
