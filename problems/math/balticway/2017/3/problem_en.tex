Positive integers $x_1,...,x_m$ (not necessarily distinct) are written on a blackboard. It is known that each of the numbers $F_1,...,F_{2018}$ can be represented as a sum of one or more of the numbers on the blackboard. What is the smallest possible value of $m$?

(Here $F_1,...,F_{2018}$ are the first $2018$ Fibonacci numbers: $F_1=F_2=1, F_{k+1}=F_k+F_{k-1}$ for $k>1$.)
