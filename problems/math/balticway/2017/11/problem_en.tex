Let $H$ and $I$ be the orthocenter and incenter, respectively, of an acute-angled triangle $ABC$. The circumcircle of the triangle $BCI$ intersects the segment $AB$ at the point $P$ different from $B$. Let $K$ be the projection of $H$ onto $AI$ and $Q$ the reflection of $P$ in $K$. Show that $B$,  $H$ and $Q$ are collinear.
