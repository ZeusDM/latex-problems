Let $P$ be a point inside the acute angle $\angle BAC$. Suppose that $\angle ABP = \angle ACP = 90^{\circ}$. The points $D$ and $E$ are on the segments $BA$ and $CA$,  respectively, such that $BD = BP$ and $CP = CE$. The points $F$ and $G$ are on the segments $AC$ and $AB$,  respectively, such that $DF$ is perpendicular to $AB$ and $EG$ is perpendicular to $AC$. Show that $PF = PG$.
