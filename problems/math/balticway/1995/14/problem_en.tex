There are $n$ fleas on an infinite sheet of triangulated paper. Initially the fleas are in different small triangles, all of which are inside some equilateral triangle consisting of $n^2$ small triangles. Once a second each flea jumps from its original triangle to one of the three small triangles having a common vertex but no common side with it. For which natural numbers $n$ does there exist an initial configuration such that after a finite number of jumps all the $n$ fleas can meet in a single small triangle?
