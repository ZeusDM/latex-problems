Assume we have $95$ boxes and $19$ balls distributed in these boxes in an arbitrary manner. We take $6$ new balls at a time and place them in $6$ of the boxes, one ball in each of the six. Can we, by repeating this process a suitable number of times, achieve a situation in which each of the $95$ boxes contains an equal number of balls?
