The following construction is used for training astronauts:

A circle $C_2$ of radius $2R$ rolls along the inside of another, fixed circle $C_1$ of radius $nR$,  where $n$ is an integer greater than $2$. The astronaut is fastened to a third circle $C_3$ of radius $R$ which rolls along the inside of circle $C_2$ in such a way that the touching point of the circles $C_2$ and $C_3$ remains at maximum distance from the touching point of the circles $C_1$ and $C_2$ at all times. How many revolutions (relative to the ground) does the astronaut perform together with the circle $C_3$ while the circle $C_2$ completes one full lap around the inside of circle $C_1$?
