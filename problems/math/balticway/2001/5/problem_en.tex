Let $2001$ given points on a circle be coloured either red or green. In one step all points are recoloured simultaneously in the following way: If both direct neighbours of a point $P$ have the same colour as $P$,  then the colour of $P$ remains unchanged, otherwise $P$ obtains the other colour. Starting with the first colouring $F_1$,  we obtain the colourings $F_2,F_3 ,\ldots .$ after several recolouring steps. Prove that there is a number $n_0\le 1000$ such that $F_{n_0}=F_{n_0 +2}$. Is the assertion also true if $1000$ is replaced by $999$?
