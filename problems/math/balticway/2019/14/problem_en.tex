Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle ABC = 90^{\circ}$,  and let $H$ be the foot of the altitude from $B$. The points $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of the segments $AH$ and $CH$,  respectively. Let $P$ and $Q$ be the second points of intersection of the circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$ with the lines $BM$ and $BN$,  respectively. The segments $AQ$ and $CP$ intersect at the point $R$. Prove that the line $BR$ passes through the midpoint of the segment $MN$.
