There are $2019$ points given in the plane. A child wants to draw $k$ (closed) discs in such a manner, that for any two distinct points there exists a disc that contains exactly one of these two points. What is the minimal $k$,  such that for any initial configuration of points it is possible to draw $k$ discs with the above property?
