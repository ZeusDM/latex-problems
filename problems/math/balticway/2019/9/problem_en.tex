For a positive integer $n$,  consider all nonincreasing functions $f : \{1,\hdots,n\}\to\{1,\hdots,n\}$. Some of them have a fixed point (i.e. a $c$ such that $f(c) = c$), some do not. Determine the difference between the sizes of the two sets of functions.Remark. A function $f$ is nonincreasing if $f(x) \geq f(y)$ holds for all $x \leq y$
