Three fixed circles pass through the points $A$ and $B$. Let $X$ be a variable point on the first circle different from $A$ and $B$. The line $AX$ intersects the other two circles at $Y$ and $Z$ (with $Y$ between $X$ and $Z$). Show that the ratio $\frac{XY}{YZ}$ is independent of the position of $X$.
