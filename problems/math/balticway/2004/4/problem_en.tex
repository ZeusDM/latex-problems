Let $x_1$,  $x_2$,  ..., $x_n$ be real numbers with arithmetic mean $X$. Prove that there is a positive integer $K$ such that for any integer $i$ satisfying $0\leq i<K$,  we have $\frac{1}{K-i}\sum_{j=i+1}^{K} x_j \leq X$. (In other words, prove that there is a positive integer $K$ such that the arithmetic mean of each of the lists $\left\{x_1,x_2,...,x_K\right\}$,  $\left\{x_2,x_3,...,x_K\right\}$,  $\left\{x_3,...,x_K\right\}$,  ..., $\left\{x_{K-1},x_K\right\}$,  $\left\{x_K\right\}$ is not greater than $X$.)
