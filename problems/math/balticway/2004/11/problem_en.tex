Given a table $m\times n$,  in each cell of which a number $+1$ or $-1$ is written. It is known that initially exactly one $-1$ is in the table, all the other numbers being $+1$. During a move, it is allowed to chose any cell containing $-1$,  replace this $-1$ by $0$,  and simultaneously multiply all the numbers in the neighbouring cells by $-1$ (we say that two cells are neighbouring if they have a common side). Find all $(m,n)$ for which using such moves one can obtain the table containing zeros only, regardless of the cell in which the initial $-1$ stands.
