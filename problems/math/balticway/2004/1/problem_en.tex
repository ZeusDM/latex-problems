Given a sequence $a_1,a_2,\ldots $ of non-negative real numbers satisfying the conditions:

1. $a_n + a_{2n} \geq 3n$;

2. $a_{n+1}+n \leq 2\sqrt{a_n \left(n+1\right)}$

for all $n\in\mathbb N$ (where $\mathbb N=\left\{1,2,3,...\right\}$).

(1) Prove that the inequality $a_n \geq n$ holds for every $n \in \mathbb N$.

(2) Give an example of such a sequence.
