There are $2n$ different numbers in a row. By one move we can interchange any two numbers or interchange any $3$ numbers cyclically (choose $a,b,c$ and place $a$ instead of $b$,  $b$ instead of $c$,  $c$ instead of $a$). What is the minimal number of moves that is always sufficient to arrange the numbers in increasing order ?
