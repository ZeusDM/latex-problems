Let $D$ be the midpoint of the side $BC$ of a triangle $ABC$. Let $M$ be a point on the side $BC$ such that $\angle BAM = \angle DAC$. Further, let $L$ be the second intersection point of the circumcircle of the triangle $CAM$ with the side $AB$,  and let $K$ be the second intersection point of the circumcircle of the triangle $BAM$ with the side $AC$. Prove that $KL \parallel BC$.
