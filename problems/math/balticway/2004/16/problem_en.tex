Through a point $P$ exterior to a given circle pass a secant and a tangent to the circle. The secant intersects the circle at $A$ and $B$,  and the tangent touches the circle at $C$ on the same side of the diameter through $P$ as the points $A$ and $B$. The projection of the point $C$ on the diameter is called $Q$. Prove that the line $QC$ bisects the angle $\angle AQB$.
