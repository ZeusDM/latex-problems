The altitudes $BB_1$ and $CC_1$ of an acute triangle $ABC$ intersect in point $H$. Let $B_2$ and $C_2$ be points on the segments $BH$ and $CH$,  respectively, such that $BB_2=B_1H$ and $CC_2=C_1H$. The circumcircle of the triangle $B_2HC_2$ intersects the circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$ in points $D$ and $E$. Prove that the triangle $DEH$ is right-angled.
