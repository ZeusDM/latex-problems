Two circles in the plane do not intersect and do not lie inside each other. We choose diameters $A_1B_1$ and $A_2B_2$ of these circles such that the segments $A_1A_2$ and $B_1B_2'$ intersect. Let $A$ and $B$ be the midpoints of the segments $A_1A_2$ and $B_1B_2$,  and $C$ be the intersection point of these segments. Prove that the orthocenter of the triangle $ABC$ belongs to a fixed line that does not depend on the choice of diameters.
