A graph has $N$ vertices. An invisible hare sits in one of the vertices. A group of hunters tries to kill the hare. In each move all of them shoot simultaneously: each hunter shoots at a single vertex, they choose the target vertices cooperatively. If the hare was in one of the target vertices during a shoot, the hunt is finished. Otherwise the hare can stay in its vertex or jump to one of the neighboring vertices.

The hunters know an algorithm that allows them to kill the hare in at most $N!$ moves. Prove that then there exists an algorithm that allows them to kill the hare in at most $2^N$ moves.
