Olga and Sasha play a game on an infinite hexagonal grid. They take turns in placing a stone on a free hexagon of their choice. Olga starts the game. Just before the $2018$th stone is placed, a new rule comes into play. A stone may now be placed only on those free hexagons having at least two occupied neighbors.
