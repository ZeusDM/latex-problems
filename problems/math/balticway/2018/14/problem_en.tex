A quadrilateral $ABCD$ is circumscribed about a circle $\omega$. The intersection point of $\omega$ and the diagonal $AC$,  closest to $A$,  is $E$. The point $F$ is diametrally opposite to the point $E$ on the circle $\omega$. The tangent to $\omega$ at the point $F$ intersects lines $AB$ and $BC$ in points $A_1$ and $C_1$,  and lines $AD$ and $CD$ in points $A_2$ and $C_2$,  respectively. Prove that $A_1C_1=A_2C_2$.
