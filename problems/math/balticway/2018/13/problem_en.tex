The bisector of the angle $A$ of a triangle $ABC$ intersects $BC$ in a point $D$ and intersects the circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$ in a point $E$. Let $K,L,M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of the segments $AB,BD,CD$ and $AC$,  respectively. Let $P$  be the circumcenter of the triangle $EKL$,  and $Q$ be the circumcenter of the triangle $EMN$. Prove that $\angle PEQ=\angle BAC$.
