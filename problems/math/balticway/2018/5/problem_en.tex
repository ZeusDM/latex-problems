A polynomial $f(x)$ with real coefficients is called generating, if for each polynomial $\varphi(x)$ with real coefficients there exists a positive integer $k$ and polynomials $g_1(x),\dotsc,g_k(x)$ with real coefficients such that\[\varphi(x)=f(g_1(x))+\dotsc+f(g_k(x)).\]Find all generating polynomials.
