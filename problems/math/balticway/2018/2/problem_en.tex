A $100 \times 100$ table is given. For each $k, 1 \le k \le 100$,  the $k$-th row of the table contains the numbers $1,2,\dotsc,k$ in increasing order (from left to right) but not necessarily in consecutive cells; the remaining $100-k$ cells are filled with zeroes. Prove that there exist two columns such that the sum of the numbers in one of the columns is at least $19$ times as large as the sum of the numbers in the other column.
