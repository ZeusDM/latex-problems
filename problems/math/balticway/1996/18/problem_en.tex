The jury of an Olympiad has $30$ members in the beginning. Each member of the jury thinks that some of his colleagues are competent, while all the others are not, and these opinions do not change. At the beginning of every session a voting takes place, and those members who are not competent in the opinion of more than one half of the voters are excluded from the jury for the rest of the olympiad. Prove that after at most $15$ sessions there will be no more exclusions. (Note that nobody votes about his own competence.)
