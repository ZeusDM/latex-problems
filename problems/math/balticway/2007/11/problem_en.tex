In triangle $ABC$ let $AD,BE$ and $CF$ be the altitudes. Let the points $P,Q,R$ and $S$ fulfil the following requirements:

i) $P$ is the circumcentre of triangle $ABC$.

ii) All the segments $PQ,QR$ and $RS$ are equal to the circumradius of triangle $ABC$.

iii) The oriented segment $PQ$ has the same direction as the oriented segment $AD$. Similarly, $QR$ has the same direction as $BE$,  and $Rs$ has the same direction as $CF$.

Prove that $S$ is the incentre of triangle $ABC$.
