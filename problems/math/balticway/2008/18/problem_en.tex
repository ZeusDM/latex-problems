Let $ AB$ be a diameter of a circle $ S$,  and let $ L$ be the tangent at $ A$. Furthermore, let $ c$ be a fixed, positive real, and consider all pairs of points $ X$ and $ Y$ lying on $ L$,  on opposite sides of $ A$,  such that $ |AX|\cdot |AY| = c$. The lines $ BX$ and $ BY$ intersect $ S$ at points $ P$ and $ Q$,  respectively. Show that all the lines $ PQ$ pass through a common point.
