Suppose that Romeo and Juliet each have a regular tetrahedron to the vertices of which some positive real numbers are assigned. They associate each edge of their tetrahedra with the product of the two numbers assigned to its end points. Then they write on each face of their tetrahedra the sum of the three numbers associated to its three edges. The four numbers written on the faces of Romeo's tetrahedron turn out to coincide with the four numbers written on Juliet's tetrahedron. Does it follow that the four numbers assigned to the vertices of Romeo's tetrahedron are identical to the four numbers assigned to the vertices of Juliet's tetrahedron?
