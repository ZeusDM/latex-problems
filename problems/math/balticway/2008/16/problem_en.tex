Let $ABCD$ be a parallelogram. The circle with diameter $AC$ intersects the line $BD$ at points $P$ and $Q$. The perpendicular to the line $AC$ passing through the point $C$ intersects the lines $AB$ and $AD$ at points $X$ and $Y$,  respectively. Prove that the points $P,Q,X$ and $Y$ lie on the same circle.
