In  a school class with $ 3n$ children, any two children make a common present to exactly one other child. Prove that for all odd $ n$ it is possible that the following holds: For any three children $ A$,  $ B$ and $ C$ in the class, if $ A$ and $ B$ make a present to $ C$ then $ A$ and $ C$ make a present to $ B$.
