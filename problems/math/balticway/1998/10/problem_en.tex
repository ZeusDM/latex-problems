Let $n\ge 4$ be an even integer. A regular $n$-gon and a regular $(n-1)$-gon are inscribed into the unit circle. For each vertex of the $n$-gon consider the distance from this vertex to the nearest vertex of the $(n-1)$-gon, measured along the circumference. Let $S$ be the sum of these $n$ distances. Prove that $S$ depends only on $n$,  and not on the relative position of the two polygons.
