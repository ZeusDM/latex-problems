Given triangle $ABC$ with $AB<AC$. The line passing through $B$ and parallel to $AC$ meets the external angle bisector of $\angle BAC$ at $D$. The line passing through $C$ and parallel to $AB$ meets this bisector at $E$. Point $F$ lies on the side $AC$ and satisfies the equality $FC=AB$. Prove that $DF=FE$.
