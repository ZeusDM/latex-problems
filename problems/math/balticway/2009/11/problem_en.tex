Let $M$ be the midpoint of the side $AC$ of a triangle $ABC$,  and let $K$ be a point on the ray $BA$ beyond $A$. The line $KM$ intersects the side $BC$ at the point $L$. $P$is the point on the segment $BM$ such that $PM$ is the bisector of the angle $LPK$. The line $\ell$ passes through $A$ and is parallel to $BM$. Prove that the projection of the point $M$ onto the line $\ell$ belongs to the line $PK$.
