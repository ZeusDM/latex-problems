The numbers from 1 to 360 are partitioned into 9 subsets of consecutive integers and the sums of the numbers in each subset are arranged in the cells of a $3 \times 3$ square.  Is it possible that the square turns out to be a magic square?

Remark: A magic square is a square in which the sums of the numbers in each row, in each column and in both diagonals are all equal.
