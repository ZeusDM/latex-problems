Two players $A$ and $B$ play the following game.  Before the game starts, $A$ chooses 1000 not necessarily different odd primes, and then $B$ chooses half of them and writes them on a blackboard.  In each turn a player chooses a positive integer $n$,  erases some primes $p_1$,  $p_2$,  $\dots$,  $p_n$ from the blackboard and writes all the prime factors of $p_1 p_2 \dotsm p_n - 2$ instead (if a prime occurs several times in the prime factorization of $p_1 p_2 \dotsm p_n - 2$,  it is written as many times as it occurs).  Player $A$ starts, and the player whose move leaves the blackboard empty loses the game.  Prove that one of the two players has a winning strategy and determine who.

Remark: Since 1 has no prime factors, erasing a single 3 is a legal move.
