The circumcentre $O$ of a given cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$ lies inside the quadrilateral but not on the diagonal $AC$.  The diagonals of the quadrilateral intersect at $I$.  The circumcircle of the triangle $AOI$ meets the sides $AD$ and $AB$ at points $P$ and $Q$,  respectively; the circumcircle of the triangle $COI$ meets the sides $CB$ and $CD$ at points $R$ and $S$,  respectively.  Prove that $PQRS$ is a parallelogram.
