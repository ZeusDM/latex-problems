Let $P_0$,  $P_1$,  $\dots$,  $P_8 = P_0$ be successive points on a circle and $Q$ be a point inside the polygon $P_0 P_1 \dotsb P_7$ such that $\angle P_{i - 1} QP_i = 45^\circ$ for $i = 1$,  $\dots$,  8.  Prove that the sum\[\sum_{i = 1}^8 P_{i - 1} P_i^2\]

is minimal if and only if $Q$ is the centre of the circle.
