If we add $1996$ to $1997$,  we first add the unit digits $6$ and $7$. Obtaining $13$,  we write down $3$ and “carry” $1$ to the next column. Thus we make a carry. Continuing, we see that we are to make three carries in total.

Does there exist a positive integer $k$ such that adding $1996\cdot k$ to $1997\cdot k$ no carry arises during the whole calculation?
