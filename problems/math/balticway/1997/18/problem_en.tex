a) Prove the existence of two infinite sets $A$ and $B$,  not necessarily disjoint, of non-negative integers such that each non-negative integer $n$ is uniquely representable in the form $n=a+b$ with $a\in A,b\in B$.

b) Prove that for each such pair $(A,B)$,  either $A$ or $B$ contains only multiples of some integer $k>1$.
