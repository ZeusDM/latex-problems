Two circles $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ intersect in $P$ and $Q$. A line through $P$ intersects $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ again at $A$ and $B$,  respectively, and $X$ is the midpoint of $AB$. The line through $Q$ and $X$ intersects $C_1$ and $C_2$ again at $Y$ and $Z$,  respectively. Prove that $X$ is the midpoint of $YZ$.
