There are $2003$ pieces of candy on a table. Two players alternately make moves. A move consists of eating one candy or half of the candies on the table (the “lesser half” if there are an odd number of candies). At least one candy must be eaten at each move. The loser is the one who eats the last candy. Which player has a winning strategy?
