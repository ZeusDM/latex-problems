It is known that $n$ is a positive integer and $n \le 144$. Ten questions of the type “Is $n$ smaller than $a$?” are allowed. Answers are given with a delay: for $i = 1, \ldots , 9$,  the $i$-th question is answered only after the $(i + 1)$-th question is asked. The answer to the tenth question is given immediately.

Find a strategy for identifying $n$.
