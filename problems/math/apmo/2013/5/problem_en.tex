Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle $\omega$, and let $P$ be a point on the extension of $AC$ such that $PB$ and $PD$ are tangent to $\omega$.  The tangent at $C$ intersects $PD$ at $Q$ and the line $AD$ at $R$.  Let $E$ be the second point of intersection between $AQ$ and $\omega$. Prove that $B$, $E$, $R$ are collinear.
