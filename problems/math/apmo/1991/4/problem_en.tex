During a break, $n$ children at school sit in a circle around their teacher to play a game.  The teacher walks clockwise close to the children and hands out candies to some of them according to the following rule. He selects one child and gives him a candy, then he skips the next child and gives a candy to the next one, then he skips 2 and gives a candy to the next one, then he skips 3, and so on. Determine the values of $n$ for which eventually, perhaps after many rounds, all children will have at least one candy each.
