Let $G$ be the centroid of a triangle $ABC$ and $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Let $X$ be on $AB$ and $Y$ on $AC$ such that the points $X$, $Y$, and $G$ are collinear and $XY$ and $BC$ are parallel. Suppose that $XC$ and $GB$ intersect at $Q$ and $YB$ and $GC$ intersect at $P$. Show that triangle $MPQ$ is similar to triangle $ABC$.
