Let $ABC$ be an acute angled triangle satisfying the conditions $AB>BC$ and $AC>BC$. Denote by $O$ and $H$ the circumcenter and orthocenter, respectively, of the triangle $ABC.$ Suppose that the circumcircle of the triangle $AHC$ intersects the line $AB$ at $M$ different from $A$, and the circumcircle of the triangle $AHB$ intersects the line $AC$ at $N$ different from $A.$ Prove that the circumcenter of the triangle $MNH$ lies on the line $OH$.
