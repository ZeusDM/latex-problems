For a positive integer $k,$ call an integer a \emph{pure $k$-th power} if it can be represented as $m^k$ for some integer $m$. Show that for every positive integer $n$, there exists $n$ distinct positive integers such that their sum is a pure $2009$-th power and their product is a pure $2010$-th power.
