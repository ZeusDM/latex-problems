Let two equal regular $n$-gons $S$ and $T$ be located in the plane such that their intersection $S\cap T$ is a $2n$-gon ($n\ge 3$). The sides of the polygon $S$ are coloured in red and the sides of $T$ in blue. 

Prove that the sum of the lengths of the blue sides of the polygon $S\cap T$ is equal to the sum of the lengths of its red sides.
