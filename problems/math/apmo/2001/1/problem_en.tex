For a positive integer $n$ let $S(n)$ be the sum of digits in the decimal representation of $n$.   Any positive integer obtained by removing several (at least one) digits from the right-hand end of the decimal representation of $n$ is called a \emph{stump} of $n$. Let $T(n)$ be the sum of all stumps of $n$. Prove that $n=S(n)+9T(n)$.
