Let $n$ and $b$ be positive integers. We say $n$ is \emph{$b$-discerning} if there exists a set consisting of $n$ different positive integers less than $b$ that has no two different subsets $U$ and $V$ such that the sum of all elements in $U$ equals the sum of all elements in $V$.

	\item Prove that $9$ is not $100$-discerning.
