Circles $\omega$ and $\Omega$ meet at points $A$ and $B$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of the arc $AB$ of circle $\omega$ ($M$ lies inside $\Omega$). A chord $MP$ of circle $\omega$ intersects $\Omega$ at $Q$ ($Q$ lies inside $\omega$). Let $\ell_P$ be the tangent line to $\omega$ at $P$, and let $\ell_Q$ be the tangent line to $\Omega$ at $Q$. Prove that the circumcircle of the triangle formed by the lines $\ell_P$, $\ell_Q$ and $AB$ is tangent to $\Omega$.
