Let $S = \{1,2,\dots,2014\}$. For each non-empty subset $T \subseteq S$, one of its members is chosen as its \emph{representative}. Find the number of ways to assign representatives to all non-empty subsets of $S$ so that if a subset $D \subseteq S$ is a disjoint union of non-empty subsets $A, B, C \subseteq S$, then the representative of $D$ is also the representative of one of $A$, $B$, $C$.
