For a positive integer $m$ denote by $S(m)$ and $P(m)$ the sum and product, respectively, of the digits of $m$. Show that for each positive integer $n$, there exist positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ satisfying the following conditions: \[ S(a_1) < S(a_2) < \cdots < S(a_n) \text{ and } S(a_i) = P(a_{i+1}) \quad (i=1,2,\ldots,n). \] (We let $a_{n+1} = a_1$.)
