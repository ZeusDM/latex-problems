Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $D$ the foot of the altitude from $A$. Let $E$ and $F$ lie on a line passing through $D$ such that $AE$ is perpendicular to $BE$, $AF$ is perpendicular to $CF$, and $E$ and $F$ are different from $D$. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of the segments $BC$ and $EF$, respectively. Prove that $AN$ is perpendicular to $NM$.
