Given a permutation ($a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n$) of the sequence $0, 1,\ldots, n$. A transposition of $a_i$ with $a_j$ is called \emph{legal} if $a_i=0$ for $i>0$, and $a_{i-1}+1=a_j$. The permutation ($a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n$) is called \emph{regular} if after a number of legal transposition it becomes ($1,2, \ldots, n,0$).
For which numbers $n$ is the permutation ($1, n, n-1, \ldots, 3, 2, 0$) regular?
