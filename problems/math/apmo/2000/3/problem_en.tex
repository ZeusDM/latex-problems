Let $ABC$ be a triangle. Let $M$ and $N$ be the points in which the median and the angle bisector, respectively, at $A$ meet the side $BC$. Let $Q$ and $P$ be the points in which the perpendicular at $N$ to $NA$ meets $MA$ and $BA$, respectively. And $O$ the point in which the perpendicular at $P$ to $BA$ meets $AN$ produced. Prove that $QO$ is perpendicular to $BC$.
