Given a $32 \times 32$ table, we put a mouse (facing up) at the bottom left cell and a piece of cheese at several other cells.  The mouse then starts moving.  It moves forward except that when it reaches a piece of cheese, it eats a part of it, turns right, and continues moving forward.  We say that a subset of cells containing cheese is good if, during this process, the mouse tastes each piece of cheese exactly once and then falls off the table.  Show that:

(a) No good subset consists of 888 cells.
(b) There exists a good subset consisting of at least 666 cells.
