Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic convex quadrilateral and $\Gamma$ be its circumcircle. Let $E$ be the intersection of the diagonals of $AC$ and $BD$. Let $L$ be the center of the circle tangent to sides $AB$, $BC$, and $CD$, and let $M$ be the midpoint of the arc $BC$ of $\Gamma$ not containing $A$ and $D$. Prove that the excenter of triangle $BCE$ opposite $E$ lies on the line $LM$.
