Let $A_1,A_2,A_3$ be three points in the plane, and for convenience, let $A_4=A_1$, $A_5=A_2$. For $n=1$, $2$, and $3$, suppose that $B_n$ is the midpoint of $A_nA_{n+1}$, and suppose that $C_n$ is the midpoint of $A_nB_n$. Suppose that $A_nC_{n+1}$ and $B_nA_{n+1}$ meet at $D_n$, and that $A_nB_{n+1}$ and $C_nA_{n+2}$ meet at $E_n$. Calculate the ratio of the area of triangle $D_1D_2D_3$ to the area of triangle $E_1E_2E_3$.
