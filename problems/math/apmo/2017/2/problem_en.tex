Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB < AC$. Let $D$ be the intersection point of the internal bisector of angle $BAC$ and the circumcircle of $ABC$. Let $Z$ be the intersection point of the perpendicular bisector of $AC$ with the external bisector of angle $\angle{BAC}$. Prove that the midpoint of the segment $AB$ lies on the circumcircle of triangle $ADZ$.
