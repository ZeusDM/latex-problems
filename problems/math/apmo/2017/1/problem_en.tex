We call a $5$-tuple of integers \emph{arrangeable} if its elements can be labeled $a, b, c, d, e$ in some order so that $a-b+c-d+e=29$. Determine all $2017$-tuples of integers $n_1, n_2, . . . , n_{2017}$ such that if we place them in a circle in clockwise order, then any $5$-tuple of numbers in consecutive positions on the circle is arrangeable.
