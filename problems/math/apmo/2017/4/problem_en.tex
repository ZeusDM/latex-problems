Call a rational number $r$ \emph{powerful} if $r$ can be expressed in the form $\dfrac{p^k}{q}$ for some relatively prime positive integers $p, q$ and some integer $k >1$. Let $a, b, c$ be positive rational numbers such that $abc = 1$. Suppose there exist positive integers $x, y, z$ such that $a^x + b^y + c^z$ is an integer. Prove that $a, b, c$ are all \emph{powerful}.
