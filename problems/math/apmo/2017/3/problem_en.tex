Let $A(n)$ denote the number of sequences $a_1\ge a_2\ge\ldots\ge a_k$ of positive integers for which $a_1+\cdots+a_k = n$ and each $a_i +1$ is a power of two $(i = 1,2,\ldots,k)$. Let $B(n)$ denote the number of sequences $b_1\ge b_2\ge\ldots\ge b_m$ of positive integers for which $b_1+\cdots+b_m =n$ and each inequality $b_j\ge 2b_{j+1}$ holds $(j=1,2,\ldots, m-1)$. Prove that $A(n) = B(n)$ for every positive integer $n$.
