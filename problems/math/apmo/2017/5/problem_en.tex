Let $n$ be a positive integer. A pair of $n$-tuples $(a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ and $(b_1,\ldots, b_n)$ with integer entries is called an \emph{exquisite pair} if \[|a_1b_1+\cdots{}+a_nb_n|\le 1.\]

Determine the maximum number of distinct $n$-tuples with integer entries such that any two of them form an exquisite pair.
