We say that a triangle $ABC$ is great if the following holds: for any point $D$ on the side $BC$, if $P$ and $Q$ are the feet of the perpendiculars from $D$ to the lines $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, then the reflection of $D$ in the line $PQ$ lies on the circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$.

Prove that triangle $ABC$ is great if and only if $\angle A = 90^{\circ}$ and $AB = AC$.
