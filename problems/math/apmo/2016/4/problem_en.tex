The country Dreamland consists of $2016$ cities. The airline Starways wants to establish some one-way flights between pairs of cities in such a way that each city has exactly one flight out of it. Find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that no matter how Starways establishes its flights, the cities can always be partitioned into $k$ groups so that from any city it is not possible to reach another city in the same group by using at most $28$ flights.
