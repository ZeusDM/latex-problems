Let $AB$ and $AC$ be two distinct rays not lying on the same line, and let $\omega$ be a circle with center $O$ that is tangent to ray $AC$ at $E$ and ray $AB$ at $F$. Let $R$ be a point on segment $EF$. The line through $O$ parallel to $EF$ intersects line $AB$ at $P$. Let $N$ be the intersection of lines $PR$ and $AC$, and let $M$ be the intersection of line $AB$ and the line through $R$ parallel to $AC$. Prove that line $MN$ is tangent to $\omega$.
