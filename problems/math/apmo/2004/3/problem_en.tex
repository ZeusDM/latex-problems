Let a set $S$ of 2004 points in the plane be given, no three of which are collinear. Let $\mathcal{L}$ denote the set of all lines (extended indefinitely in both directions) determined by pairs of points from the set. Show that it is possible to colour the points of $S$ with at most two colours, such that for any points $p,q$ of $S$, the number of lines in $\mathcal{L}$ which separate $p$ from $q$ is odd if and only if $p$ and $q$ have the same colour.

\emph{Note}: A line $\ell$ separates two points $p$ and $q$ if $p$ and $q$ lie on opposite sides of $\ell$ with neither point on $\ell$.
