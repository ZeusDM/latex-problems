Let $n$ be a positive integer. Consider $2n$ distinct lines on the plane, no two of which are parallel. Of the $2n$ lines, $n$ are colored blue, the other $n$ are colored red. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the set of all points on the plane that lie on at least one blue line, and $\mathcal{R}$ the set of all points on the plane that lie on at least one red line. Prove that there exists a circle that intersects $\mathcal{B}$ in exactly $2n - 1$ points, and also intersects $\mathcal{R}$ in exactly $2n - 1$ points.
