A sequence of real numbers $a_0, a_1,\ldots$ is said to be \emph{good} if the following three conditions hold.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item The value of $a_0$ is a positive integer.
	\item For each non-negative integer $i$ we have $a_{i+1} = 2a_i + 1 $ or $a_{i+1} =\frac{a_i}{a_i + 2} $.
	\item There exists a positive integer $k$ such that $a_k = 2014$.
\end{enumerate}
Find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that there exists a good sequence $a_0, a_1,\ldots$ of real numbers with the property that $a_n = 2014$.
