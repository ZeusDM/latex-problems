Let three circles $ \Gamma_1, \Gamma_2, \Gamma_3$, which are non-overlapping and mutually external, be given in the plane. For each point $ P$ in the plane, outside the three circles, construct six points $ A_1, B_1, A_2, B_2, A_3, B_3$ as follows: For each $ i = 1, 2, 3$, $ A_i, B_i$ are distinct points on the circle $ \Gamma_i$ such that the lines $ PA_i$ and $ PB_i$ are both tangents to $ \Gamma_i$. Call the point $ P$ \emph{exceptional} if, from the construction, three lines $ A_1B_1, A_2 B_2, A_3 B_3$ are concurrent. Show that every exceptional point of the plane, if exists, lies on the same circle.
