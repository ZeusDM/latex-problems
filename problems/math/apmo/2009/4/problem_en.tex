Prove that for any positive integer $ k$, there exists an arithmetic sequence \[ \frac{a_1}{b_1}, \frac{a_2}{b_2}, \frac{a_3}{b_3}, \ldots ,\frac{a_k}{b_k}\] of rational numbers, where $ a_i, b_i$ are relatively prime positive integers for each $ i = 1,2,\ldots,k$, such that the positive integers $ a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \ldots,  a_k, b_k$ are all distinct.
