Consider the following operation on positive real numbers written on a blackboard: \emph{Choose a number $ r$ written on the blackboard, erase that number, and then write a pair of positive real numbers $ a$ and $ b$ satisfying the condition $ 2 r^2 = ab$ on the board. }

Assume that you start out with just one positive real number $ r$ on the blackboard, and apply this operation $ k^2 - 1$ times to end up with $ k^2$ positive real numbers, not necessarily distinct. Show that there exists a number on the board which does not exceed $kr$.
