Consider $n$ disks $C_{1}, C_{2}, \ldots , C_{n}$ in a plane such that for each $1 \leq i < n$, the center of $C_{i}$ is on the circumference of $C_{i+1}$, and the center of $C_{n}$ is on the circumference of $C_{1}$. Define the \emph{score} of such an arrangement of $n$ disks to be the number of pairs $(i, j )$ for which $C_{i}$ properly contains $C_{j}$ . Determine the maximum possible score.
