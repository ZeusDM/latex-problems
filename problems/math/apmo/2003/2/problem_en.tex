Suppose $ABCD$ is a square piece of cardboard with side length $a$. On a plane are two parallel lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$, which are also $a$ units apart. The square $ABCD$ is placed on the plane so that sides $AB$ and $AD$ intersect $\ell_1$ at $E$ and $F$ respectively. Also, sides $CB$ and $CD$ intersect $\ell_2$ at $G$ and $H$ respectively. Let the perimeters of $\triangle AEF$ and $\triangle CGH$ be $m_1$ and $m_2$ respectively. Prove that no matter how the square was placed, $m_1+m_2$ remains constant.
