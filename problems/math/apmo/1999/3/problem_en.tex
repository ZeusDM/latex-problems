Let $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ be two circles intersecting at $P$ and $Q$. The common tangent, closer to $P$, of $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ touches $\Gamma_1$ at $A$ and $\Gamma_2$ at $B$. The tangent of $\Gamma_1$ at $P$ meets $\Gamma_2$ at $C$, which is different from $P$, and the extension of $AP$ meets $BC$ at $R$. Prove that the circumcircle of triangle $PQR$ is tangent to $BP$ and $BR$.
