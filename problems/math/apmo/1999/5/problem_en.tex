Let $S$ be a set of $2n+1$ points in the plane such that no three are collinear and no four concyclic. A circle will be called \emph{good} if it has 3 points of $S$ on its circumference, $n-1$ points in its interior and $n-1$ points in its exterior. Prove that the number of good circles has the same parity as $n$.
