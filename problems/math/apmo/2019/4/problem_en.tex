Consider a $2018 \times 2019$ board with integers in each unit square. Two unit squares are said to be neighbours if they share a common edge. In each turn, you choose some unit squares. Then for each chosen unit square the average of all its neighbours is calculated. Finally, after these calculations are done, the number in each chosen unit square is replaced by the corresponding average.

Is it always possible to make the numbers in all squares become the same after finitely many turns?
