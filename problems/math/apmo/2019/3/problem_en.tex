Let $ABC$ be a scalene triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. A variable point $P$ is selected in the line segment $AM$. The circumcircles of triangles $BPM$ and $CPM$ intersect $\Gamma$ again at points $D$ and $E$,  respectively. The lines $DP$ and $EP$ intersect (a second time) the circumcircles to triangles $CPM$ and $BPM$ at $X$ and $Y$,  respectively. Prove that as $P$ varies, the circumcircle of $\triangle AXY$ passes through a fixed point $T$ distinct from $A$.
