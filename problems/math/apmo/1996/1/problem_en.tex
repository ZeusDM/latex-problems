Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral $AB = BC = CD = DA$.  Let $MN$ and $PQ$ be two segments perpendicular to the diagonal $BD$ and such that the distance between them is $d > \frac{BD}{2}$, with $M \in AD$, $N \in DC$, $P \in AB$, and $Q \in BC$. Show that the perimeter of hexagon $AMNCQP$ does not depend on the position of $MN$ and $PQ$ so long as the distance between them remains constant.
