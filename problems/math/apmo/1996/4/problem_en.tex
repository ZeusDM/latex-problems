The National Marriage Council wishes to invite $n$ couples to form 17 discussion groups under the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item All members of a group must be of the same sex; i.e. they are either all male or all female.
	\item The difference in the size of any two groups is 0 or 1.
	\item All groups have at least 1 member.
	\item Each person must belong to one and only one group.
\end{enumerate}
Find all values of $n$, $n \leq 1996$, for which this is possible. Justify your answer.
