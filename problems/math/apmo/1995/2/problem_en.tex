Let $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ be a sequence of integers with values between $2$ and $1995$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item Any two of the $a_i$'s are relatively prime,
	\item Each $a_i$ is either a prime or a product of primes.
\end{enumerate}
Determine the smallest possible values of $n$ to make sure that the sequence will contain a prime number.
