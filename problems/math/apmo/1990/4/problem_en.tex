A set of 1990 persons is divided into non-intersecting subsets in such a way that
\begin{enumerate}
	\item No one in a subset knows all the others in the subset,
	\item Among any three persons in a subset, there are always at least two who do not know each other, and
	\item For any two persons in a subset who do not know each other, there is exactly one person in the same subset knowing both of them.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Prove that within each subset, every person has the same number of acquaintances.
	\item Determine the maximum possible number of subsets.
\end{enumerate}
Note: It is understood that if a person $A$ knows person $B$, then person $B$ will know person $A$; an acquaintance is someone who is known. Every person is assumed to know one's self.
