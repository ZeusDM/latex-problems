Let $P_1$, $P_2$, $\ldots$, $P_{1993} = P_0$ be distinct points in the $xy$-plane
with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item both coordinates of $P_i$ are integers, for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, 1993$;
	\item there is no point other than $P_i$ and $P_{i+1}$ on the line segment joining $P_i$ with $P_{i+1}$ whose coordinates are both integers, for $i = 0, 1, \ldots, 1992$.
\end{enumerate}
Prove that for some $i$, $0 \leq i \leq 1992$, there exists a point $Q$ with coordinates $(q_x, q_y)$ on the line segment joining $P_i$ with $P_{i+1}$ such that both $2q_x$ and $2q_y$ are odd integers.
