Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral such that all sides have equal length and $\angle{ABC} =60^\circ$.  Let $l$ be a line passing through $D$ and not intersecting the quadrilateral (except at $D$).  Let $E$ and $F$ be the points of intersection of $l$ with $AB$ and $BC$ respectively.  Let $M$ be the point of intersection of $CE$ and $AF$.

Prove that $CA^2 = CM \times CE$.
