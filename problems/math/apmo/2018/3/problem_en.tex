A collection of $n$ squares on the plane is called \emph{tri-connected} if the following criteria are satisfied:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item All the squares are congruent.
	\item If two squares have a point $P$ in common, then $P$ is a vertex of each of the squares.
	\item Each square touches exactly three other squares.
\end{enumerate}
How many positive integers $n$ are there with $2018\leq n \leq 3018$, such that there exists
a collection of $n$ squares that is tri-connected?
