Let $H$ be the orthocenter of the triangle $ABC$. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of the sides $AB$ and $AC$, respectively. Assume that $H$ lies inside the quadrilateral $BMNC$ and that the circumcircles of triangles $BMH$ and $CNH$ are tangent to each other. The line through $H$ parallel to $BC$ intersects the circumcircles of the triangles $BMH$ and $CNH$ in the points $K$ and $L$, respectively. Let $F$ be the intersection point of $MK$ and $NL$ and let $J$ be the incenter of triangle $MHN$. Prove that $F J = F A$.
