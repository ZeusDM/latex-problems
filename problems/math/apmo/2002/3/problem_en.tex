Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle. Let $P$ be a point on the side $AC$ and $Q$ be a point on the side $AB$ so that both triangles $ABP$ and $ACQ$ are acute. Let $R$ be the orthocentre of triangle $ABP$ and $S$ be the orthocentre of triangle $ACQ$. Let $T$ be the point common to the segments $BP$ and $CQ$. Find all possible values of $\angle CBP$ and $\angle BCQ$ such that the triangle $TRS$ is equilateral.
