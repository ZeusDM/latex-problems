Let $A,B$ be two distinct points on a given circle $O$ and let $P$ be the midpoint of the line segment AB. Let $O_1$ be the circle tangent to the line $AB$ at $P$ and tangent to the circle $O$. Let $l$ be the tangent line, different from the line $AB$, to $O_1$ passing through $A$. Let $C$ be the intersection point, different from $A$, of $l$ and $O$. Let $Q$ be the midpoint of the line segment $BC$ and $O_2$ be the circle tangent to the line $BC$ at $Q$ and tangent to the line segment $AC$. Prove that the circle $O_2$ is tangent to the circle $O$.
