Let $n$ be an integer such that $n > 3$.  Suppose that we choose three numbers from the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$.  Using each of these three numbers only once and using addition, multiplication, and parenthesis, let us form all possible combinations.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Show that if we choose all three numbers greater than $n/2$, then the values of these combinations are all distinct.
	\item Let $p$ be a prime number such that $p \leq \sqrt{n}$.  Show that the number of ways of choosing three numbers so that the smallest one is $p$ and the values of the combinations are not all distinct is precisely the number of positive divisors of $p - 1$.
\end{enumerate}
