A triangle with sides $a$, $b$, and $c$ is given.  Denote by $s$ the semiperimeter, that is $s = (a+b+c)/2$.  Construct a triangle with sides $s - a$, $s - b$, and $s - c$.  This process is repeated until a triangle can no longer be constructed with the side lengths given.

For which original triangles can this process be repeated indefinitely?
