In a circle $C$ with centre $O$ and radius $r$, let $C_1$, $C_2$ be two circles with centres $O_1$, $O_2$ and radii $r_1$, $r_2$ respectively, so that each circle $C_i$ is internally tangent to $C$ at $A_i$ and so that $C_1$, $C_2$ are externally tangent to each other at $A$.

Prove that the three lines $OA$, $O_1 A_2$, and $O_2 A_1$ are concurrent.
