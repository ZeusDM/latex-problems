Determine all pairs $(h,s)$ of positive integers with the following property:

If one draws $h$ horizontal lines and another $s$ lines which satisfy
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item they are not horizontal,
	\item no two of them are parallel,
	\item no three of the $h + s$ lines are concurrent,
\end{enumerate}
then the number of regions formed by these $h + s$ lines is $1992$.
