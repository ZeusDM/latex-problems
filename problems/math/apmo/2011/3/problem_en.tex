Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with $\angle BAC=30^{\circ}$. The internal and external angle bisectors of $\angle ABC$ meet the line $AC$ at $B_1$ and $B_2$, respectively, and the internal and external angle bisectors of $\angle ACB$ meet the line $AB$ at $C_1$ and $C_2$, respectively. Suppose that the circles with diameters $B_1B_2$ and $C_1C_2$ meet inside the triangle $ABC$ at point $P$. Prove that $\angle BPC=90^{\circ}$.
