Determine all functions $f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$, where $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of all real numbers, satisfying the following $2$ conditions:
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item There exists a real number $M$ such that for every real number $x,f(x)<M$ is satisfied.
	\item For every pair of real numbers $x$ and $y$, \[ f(xf(y))+yf(x)=xf(y)+f(xy)\] is satisfied.
\end{enumerate}
