In each square of a chessboard with $a$ rows and $b$ columns, a $0$ or $1$ is written satisfying the following conditions.

If a row and a column intersect in a square with a $0$,  then that row and column have the same number of $0$s.If a row and a column intersect in a square with a $1$,  then that row and column have the same number of $1$s.

Find all pairs $(a,b)$ for which this is possible.
