On a line, there are $n$ closed intervals (none of which is a single point) whose union we denote by $S$. It's known that for every real number $d$,  $0<d\le 1$,  there are two points in $S$ that are a distance $d$ from each other.



(a) Show that the sum of the lengths of the$n$ closed intervals is larger than $\frac{1}{n}$.

(b) Prove that, for each positive integer $n$,  the $\frac{1}{n}$ in the statement of part (a) cannot be replaced with a larger number.
