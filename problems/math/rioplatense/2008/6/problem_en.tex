Consider a collection of stones whose total weight is $65$ pounds and each of whose stones is at most $w$ pounds. Find the largest number $w$ for which any such collection of stones can be divided into two groups whose total weights differ by at most one pound.

Note: The weights of the stones are not necessarily integers.
