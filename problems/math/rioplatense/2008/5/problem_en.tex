In triangle $ABC$,  where $AB<AC$,  let $X$,  $Y$,  $Z$ denote the points where the incircle is tangent to $BC$,  $CA$,  $AB$,  respectively. On the circumcircle of $ABC$,  let $U$ denote the midpoint of the arc $BC$ that contains the point $A$. The line $UX$ meets the circumcircle again at the point $K$. Let $T$ denote the point of intersection of $AK$ and $YZ$. Prove that $XT$ is perpendicular to $YZ$.
