Let $S$ be a set of $N \ge 3$ points in the plane. Assume that no $3$ points in $S$ are collinear. The segments with both endpoints in $S$ are colored in two colors.

Prove that there is a set of $N - 1$ segments of the same color which don't intersect except in their endpoints such that no subset of them forms a polygon with positive area.
