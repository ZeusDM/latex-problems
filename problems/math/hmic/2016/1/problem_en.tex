Theseus starts at the point $(0, 0)$ in the plane. If Theseus is standing at the point $(x, y)$ in the plane, he can step one unit to the north to point $(x, y+1)$,  one unit to the west to point $(x-1, y)$,  one unit to the south to point $(x, y-1)$,  or one unit to the east to point $(x+1, y)$. After a sequence of more than two such moves, starting with a step one unit to the south (to point $(0, -1)$), Theseus finds himself back at the point $(0, 0)$. He never visited any point other than $(0, 0)$ more than once, and never visited the point $(0, 0)$ except at the start and end of this sequence of moves.

Let $X$
 be the number of times that Theseus took a step one unit to the north, 
and then a step one unit to the west immediately afterward. Let $Y$
 be the number of times that Theseus took a step one unit to the west, 
and then a step one unit to the north immediately afterward. Prove that $|X - Y| = 1$.
