Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with circumcenter $O$,  orthocenter $H$,  and circumcircle $\Omega$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $AH$ and $N$ the midpoint of $BH$. Assume the points $M$,  $N$,  $O$,  $H$ are distinct and lie on a circle $\omega$. Prove that the circles $\omega$ and $\Omega$ are internally tangent to each other.
