Let $S = \{a_1, \ldots, a_n \}$ be a finite set of positive integers of size $n \ge 1$,  and let $T$ be the set of all positive integers that can be expressed as sums of perfect powers (including $1$) of distinct numbers in $S$,  meaning\[ T = \left\{ \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^{e_i} \mid e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n \ge 0 \right\}. \]Show that there is a positive integer $N$ (only depending on $n$) such that $T$ contains no arithmetic progression of length $N$.
