Let $n$ be a positive integer. Alice writes $n$ real numbers $a_1, a_2,\dots, a_n$ in a line (in that order). Every move, she picks one number and replaces it with the average of itself and its neighbors ($a_n$ is not a neighbor of $a_1$, nor vice versa). A number \textit{changes sign} if it changes from being nonnegative to negative or vice versa. In terms of $n$, determine the maximum number of times that $a_1$ can change sign, across all possible values of $a_1,a_2,\dots, a_n$ and all possible sequences of moves Alice may make.
