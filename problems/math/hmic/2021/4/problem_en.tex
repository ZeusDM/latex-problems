Let $A_1A_2A_3A_4$, $B_1B_2B_3B_4$, and $C_1C_2C_3C_4$ be three regular tetrahedra in $3$-dimensional space, no two of which are congruent. Suppose that, for each $i\in \{1,2,3,4\}$, $C_i$ is the midpoint of the line segment $A_iB_i$. Determine whether the four lines $A_1B_1$, $A_2B_2$, $A_3B_3$, and $A_4B_4$ must concur.
