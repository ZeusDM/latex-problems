A deck is a collection of 52 pairs (\emph{cards}) of the form $(n, s)$ where $1 \le n \le 13$ is the number on the card, and the suit $s$ of the card is one of the symbols: tile, heart, pike, clover.

Given an arbitrary partition of a deck into $13$ sets $S_1, S_2, \dots, S_{13}$ of $4$ cards each, prove that there exists a corresponding partition $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$ of the deck into $4$ sets of $13$ cards each, such that each of the parts $C_i\ (1 \le i \le 4)$ satisfies:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $C_i$ has one card from $S_j$ for $1 \le j \le 13$;
	\item the cards in $C_i$ all have different numbers.
\end{itemize}
