Let $n, m$ be integers greater than $1$, and let $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m$ be positive integers not greater than $n^m$. Prove that there exist positive integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$ not greater than $n$, such that \[ \gcd(a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, \dots, a_m + b_m) < n, \] where $\gcd(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m)$ denotes the greatest common divisor of $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m$.
