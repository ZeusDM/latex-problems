Let $D$ and $E$ be points in the interiors of sides $AB$ and $AC$, respectively, of a triangle $ABC$, such that $DB = BC = CE$. Let the lines $CD$ and $BE$ meet at $F$. Prove that the incentre $I$ of triangle $ABC$, the orthocentre $H$ of triangle $DEF$ and the midpoint $M$ of the arc $BAC$ of the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ are collinear.
