Consider the triangle $ABC$ with $\angle BCA > 90^{\circ}$.  The circumcircle $\Gamma$ of $ABC$ has radius $R$.  There is a point $P$ in the interior of the line segment $AB$ such that $PB = PC$ and the length of $PA$ is $R$.  The perpendicular bisector of $PB$ intersects $\Gamma$ at the points $D$ and $E$.

Prove $P$ is the incentre of triangle $CDE$.
