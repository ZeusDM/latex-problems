Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $CA=CB$ and $\angle{ACB}=120^\circ$, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $AB$. Let $P$ be a variable point on the circumcircle of $ABC$, and let $Q$ be the point on the segment $CP$ such that $QP=2QC$. It is given that the line through $P$ and perpendicular to $AB$ intersects the line $MQ$ at a unique point $N$.

Prove that there exists a fixed circle such that $N$ lies on this circle for all possible positions of $P$.
