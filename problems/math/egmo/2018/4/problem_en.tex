A \emph{domino} is a $1\times2$ or $2\times1$ tile.

Let $n\geq3$ be an integer. Dominoes are placed on an $n\times n$ board in such a way that each domino covers exactly two cells of the board, and dominoes do not overlap.

The \emph{value} of a row or column is the number of dominoes that cover at least one cell of this row or column. The configuration is called \emph{balanced} if there exists some $k\geq1$ such that each row and each column has a value of $k$.

Prove that a balanced configuration exists for every $n\geq3$, and find the minimum number of dominoes needed in such a configuration.
