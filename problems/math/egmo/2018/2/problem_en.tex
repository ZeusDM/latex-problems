Consider the set \[A=\left\{1+\frac{1}{k}:k=1,2,3,\ldots\right\}.\]

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	
	\item Prove that every integer $x\geq2$ can be written as the product of one or more elements of $A$, which are not necessarily different.
	
	\item For every integer $x\geq2$, let $f\left(x\right)$ denote the minimum integer such that $x$ can be written as the product of $f\left(x\right)$ elements of $A$, which are not necessarily different.
	
	Prove that there exist infinitely many pairs $\left(x,y\right)$ of integers with $x\geq2,y\geq2$, and \[f\left(xy\right)<f\left(x\right)+f\left(y\right).\] (Pairs $\left(x_1,y_1\right)$ and $\left(x_2,y_2\right)$ are different if $x_1\neq x_2$ or $y_1\neq y_2$.)
	
\end{enumerate}
