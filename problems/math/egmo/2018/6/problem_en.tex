\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

	\item Prove that for every real number $t$ such that $0<t<\frac{1}{2}$ there exists a positive integer $n$ with the following property: for every set $S$ of $n$ positive integers there exist two different elements $x$ and $y$ of $S$, and a \emph{non-negative} integer $m$ (i.e. $m\geq0$), such that \[\left|x-my\right|\leq ty.\]
	
	\item Determine whether for every real number $t$ such that $0<t<\frac{1}{2}$ there exists an infinite set $S$ of positive integers such that \[\left|x-my\right|>ty\] for every pair of different elements $x$ and $y$ of $S$ and every \emph{positive} integer $m$ (i.e. $m>0$).
