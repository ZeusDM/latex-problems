Let $ABC$ be a triangle such that $\angle{CAB}>\angle{ABC}$, and let $I$ be its incentre. Let $D$ be the point on segment $BC$ such that $\angle{CAD}=\angle{ABC}$. Let $\omega$ be the circle tangent to $AC$ at $A$ and passing through $I$. Let $X$ be the second point of intersection of $\omega$ and the circumcircle of $ABC$. Prove that the angle bisectors of $\angle{DAB}$ and $\angle{CXB}$ intersect at a point on line $BC$.
