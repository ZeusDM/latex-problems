Let $n$ be a positive integer. Dominoes are placed on a $2n\times2n$ board in such a way that every cell of the board is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino. For each $n$, determine the largest number of dominoes that can be placed in this way.

(A \emph{domino} is a tile of size $2\times1$ or $1\times2$. Dominoes are placed on the board in such a way that each domino covers exactly two cells of the board, and dominoes do not overlap. Two cells are said to be \emph{adjacent} if they are different and share a common side.)
