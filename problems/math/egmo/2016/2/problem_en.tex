Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral, and let diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $X$. Let $C_1,D_1$ and $M$ be the midpoints of segments $CX,DX$ and $CD$, respecctively. Lines $AD_1$ and $BC_1$ intersect at $Y$, and line $MY$ intersects diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ at different points $E$ and $F$, respectively. Prove that line $XY$ is tangent to the circle through $E,F$ and $X$.
