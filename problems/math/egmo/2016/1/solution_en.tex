Suppose that $x_i^2+x_{i+1}^2>2x_jx_{j+1}$ for all $i,j$. Then $x_k^2+x_{k+1}^2>2x_kx_{k+1}$ so $x_k\neq x_{k+1}$.

The key claim is that $\Delta x_i$ and $\Delta x_{i+1}$ have opposite signs, where $\Delta x_k=x_{k+1}-x_k$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Suppose $x_i<x_{i+1}$. Then \[2x_{i+1}x_{i+2}<x_i^2+x_{i+1}^2<2x_{i+1}^2\] so $x_{i+2}<x_{i+1}$.
	\item Suppose $x_i>x_{i+1}$. Then \[x_{i+1}^2+x_{i+2}^2>2x_ix_{i+1}>2x_{i+1}^2\] so $x_{i+2}>x_{i+1}$.
\end{itemize}
But then $\Delta x_1$ and $\Delta x_{n+1}$ have opposite signs since $1$ and $n+1$ have opposite parity, contradiction.
