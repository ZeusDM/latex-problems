Let $S$ be the set of all positive integers $n$ such that $n^4$ has a divisor in the range $n^2 +1, n^2 + 2,\ldots,n^2 + 2n$. Prove that there are infinitely many elements of $S$ of each of the forms $7m, 7m+1, 7m+2, 7m+5, 7m+6$ and no elements of $S$ of the form $7m+3$ and $7m+4$, where $m$ is an integer.
