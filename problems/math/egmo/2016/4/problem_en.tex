Two circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, of equal radius intersect at different points $X_1$ and $X_2$. Consider a circle $\omega$ externally tangent to $\omega_1$ at $T_1$, and internally tangent to $\omega_2$ at point $T_2$. Prove that lines $X_1T_1$ and $X_2T_2$ intersect at a point lying on $\omega$.
