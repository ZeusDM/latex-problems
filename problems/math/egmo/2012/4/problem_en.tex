A set $A$ of integers is called \emph{sum-full} if $A\subseteq A+A$, i.e. each element $a\in A$ is the sum of some pair of (not necessarily different) elements $b,c\in A$. A set $A$ of integers is said to be \emph{zero-sum-free} if $0$ is the only integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of the elements of a finite nonempty subset of $A$.

Does there exist a sum-full zero-sum-free set of integers?
