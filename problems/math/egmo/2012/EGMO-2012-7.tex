Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$ and orthocentre $H$. Let $K$ be a point of $\Gamma$ on the other side of $BC$ from $A$. Let $L$ be the reflection of $K$ in the line $AB$, and let $M$ be the reflection of $K$ in the line $BC$. Let $E$ be the second point of intersection of $\Gamma$ with the circumcircle of triangle $BLM$.

Show that the lines $KH$, $EM$ and $BC$ are concurrent. (The orthocentre of a triangle is the point on all three of its altitudes.)
