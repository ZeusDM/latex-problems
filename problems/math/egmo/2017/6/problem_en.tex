Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle in which no two sides have the same length. The reflections of the centroid $G$ and the circumcentre $O$ of $ABC$ in its sides $BC,CA,AB$ are denoted by $G_1,G_2,G_3$ and $O_1,O_2,O_3$, respectively. Show that the circumcircles of triangles $G_1G_2C$, $G_1G_3B$, $G_2G_3A$, $O_1O_2C$, $O_1O_3B$, $O_2O_3A$ and $ABC$ have a common point. 

\emph{The centroid of a triangle is the intersection point of the three medians. A median is a line connecting a vertex of the triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side.}
