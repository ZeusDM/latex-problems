Let $n\geq1$ be an integer and let $t_1<t_2<\dots<t_n$ be positive integers. In a group of $t_n+1$ people, some games of chess are played. Two people can play each other at most once. Prove that it is possible for the following two conditions to hold at the same time: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item The number of games played by each person is one of $t_1,t_2,\dots,t_n$.
	\item For every $i$ with $1\leq i\leq n$, there is someone who has played exactly $t_i$ games of chess.
\end{enumerate}
