Find the smallest positive integer $k$ for which there exists a colouring of the positive integers $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with $k$ colours and a function $f:\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\to \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with the following two properties:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
	\item For all positive integers $m,n$ of the same colour, $f(m+n)=f(m)+f(n)$.
	\item There are positive integers $m,n$ such that $f(m+n)\ne f(m)+f(n)$.
\end{enumerate}

\emph{In a colouring of $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with $k$ colours, every integer is coloured in exactly one of the $k$ colours. In both (i) and (ii) the positive integers $m,n$ are not necessarily distinct.}
