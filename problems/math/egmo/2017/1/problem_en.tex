Let $ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral with $\angle{DAB}=\angle{BCD}=90^\circ$ and $\angle{ABC}>\angle{CDA}$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be points on segments $BC$ and $CD$, respectively, such that line $QR$ intersects lines $AB$ and $AD$ at points $P$ and $S$, respectively. It is given that $PQ=RS$. Let the midpoint of $BD$ be $M$ and the midpoint of $QR$ be $N$. Prove that the points $M$, $N$, $A$, and $C$ lie on a circle.
