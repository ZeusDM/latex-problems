Let $ABC$ be a triangle with an obtuse angle at $A$. Let $E$ and $F$ be the intersections of the external bisector of angle $A$ with the altitudes of $ABC$ through $B$ and $C$ respectively. Let $M$ and $N$ be the points on the segments $EC$ and $FB$ respectively such that $\angle EMA = \angle BCA$ and $\angle ANF = \angle ABC$. Prove that the points $E, F, N, M$ lie on a circle.
