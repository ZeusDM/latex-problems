Does there exist a nonnegative integer $a$ for which the equation
\[\left\lfloor\frac{m}{1}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\right\rfloor + \left\lfloor\frac{m}{3}\right\rfloor + \cdots + \left\lfloor\frac{m}{m}\right\rfloor = n^2 + a\]has more than one million different solutions $(m, n)$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers?
