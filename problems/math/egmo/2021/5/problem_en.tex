A plane has a special point $O$ called the origin. Let $P$ be a set of 2021 points in the plane such that
\begin{itemize}
	\item no three points in $P$ lie on a line and
	\item no two points in $P$ lie on a line through the origin.
\end{itemize}
A triangle with vertices in $P$ is \textit{fat} if $O$ is strictly inside the triangle. Find the maximum number of fat triangles.
