Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incenter $I$ and let $D$ be an arbitrary point on the side $BC$. Let the line through $D$ perpendicular to $BI$ intersect $CI$ at $E$. Let the line through $D$ perpendicular to $CI$ intersect $BI$ at $F$. Prove that the reflection of $A$ across the line $EF$ lies on the line $BC$.
