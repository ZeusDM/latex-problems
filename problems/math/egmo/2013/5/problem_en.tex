Let $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$. The circle $\omega$ is tangent to the sides $AC$ and $BC$, and it is internally tangent to the circle $\Omega$ at the point $P$.  A line parallel to $AB$ intersecting the interior of triangle $ABC$ is tangent to $\omega$ at $Q$.

Prove that $\angle{ACP}=\angle{QCB}$.
