Let $n$ be a positive integer.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Prove that there exists a set $S$ of $6n$ pairwise different positive integers, such that the least common multiple of any two elements of $S$ is no larger than $32n^2$.
	\item Prove that every set $T$ of $6n$ pairwise different positive integers contains two elements the least common multiple of which is larger than $9n^2$.
\end{enumerate}
