We have $n$ keys, each of them belonging to exactly one of $n$ locked chests. Our goal is to decide which key opens which chest. In one try we may choose a key and a chest, and check whether the chest can be opened with the key. Find the minimal number $p(n)$ with the property that using $p(n)$ tries, we can surely discover which key belongs to which chest.
