Points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ are such that no three of them are collinear. Let $E=AB\cap CD$ and $F=BC\cap DA$. Let $k_1$, $k_2$ and $k_3$ denote the circles with diameter $\overline{AC}$, $\overline{BD}$ and $\overline{EF}$, respectively. Prove that either $k_1,k_2,k_3$ pass through one point, or no two of them intersect.
