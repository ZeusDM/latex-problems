Given in the plane is a lattice and a grid rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. We divide the rectangle into grid triangles with area $\frac12$. Prove that the number of right angled triangles is at least twice as much as the shorter side of the rectangle.

(A grid polygon is a polygon such that both coordinates of each vertex is an integer.)
