Triangle $ABC$ is not isosceles. The incircle of $\triangle ABC$ touches the sides $BC$, $CA$, $AB$ in the points $K$, $L$, $M$. The parallel with $LM$ through $B$ meets $KL$ at $D$, the parallel with $LM$ through $C$ meets $KM$ at $E$.

Prove that $DE$ passes through the midpoint of $\overline{LM}$.
