For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, define the \textit{power sum} of $n$ as follows. For every prime divisor $p$ of $n$, consider the largest positive integer $k$ for which $p^k\le n$, and sum up all the $p^k$'s. (For instance, the power sum of $100$ is $2^6+5^2=89$.) Prove that the \textit{power sum} of $n$ is larger than $n$ for infinitely many positive integers $n$.
