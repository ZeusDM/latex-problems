We have placed some red and blue points along a circle. The following operations are permitted:

(a) we may add a red point somewhere and switch the color of its neighbors,

(b) we may take off a red point from somewhere and switch the color of its neighbors (if there are at least $3$ points on the circle and there is a red one too).

Initially, there are two blue points on the circle. Using a number of these operations, can we reach a state with exactly two red point?
