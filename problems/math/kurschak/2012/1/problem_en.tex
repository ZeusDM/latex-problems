Let $J_A$ and $J_B$ be the $A$-excenter and $B$-excenter of $\triangle ABC$. Consider a chord $\overline{PQ}$ of circle $ABC$ which is parallel to $AB$ and intersects segments $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BC}$. If lines $AB$ and $CP$ intersect at $R$, prove that
$$\angle J_AQJ_B+\angle J_ARJ_B=180^\circ.$$
