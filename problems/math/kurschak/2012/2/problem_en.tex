Denote by $E(n)$ the number of $1$'s in the binary representation of a positive integer $n$. Call $n$ \textit{interesting} if $E(n)$ divides $n$. Prove that
(a) there cannot be five consecutive interesting numbers, and
(b) there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $n$, $n+1$ and $n+2$ are each interesting.
