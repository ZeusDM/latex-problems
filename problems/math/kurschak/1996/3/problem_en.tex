Let $n$ and $k$ be arbitrary non-negative integers. Suppose we have drawn $2kn+1$ (different) diagonals of a convex $n$-gon. Show that there exists a broken line formed by $2k+1$ of these diagonals that passes through no point more than once. Prove also that this is not necessarily true when we draw only $kn$ diagonals.
