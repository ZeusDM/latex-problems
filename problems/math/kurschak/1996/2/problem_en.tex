Two countries ($A$ and $B$) organize a conference, and they send an equal number of participants. Some of them have known each other from a previous conference. Prove that one can choose a nonempty subset $C$ of the participants from $A$ such that one of the following holds:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the participants from $B$ each know an even number of people in $C$,
	\item the participants from $B$ each know an odd number of participants in $C$.
\end{itemize}
