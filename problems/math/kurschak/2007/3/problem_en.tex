Prove that any finite set $H$ of lattice points on the plane has a subset $K$ with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item any vertical or horizontal line in the plane cuts $K$ in at most $2$ points,
	\item any point of $H\setminus K$ is contained by a segment with endpoints from $K$.
\end{itemize}
