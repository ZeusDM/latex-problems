We would like to give a present to one of $100$ children. We do this by throwing a biased coin $k$ times, after predetermining who wins in each possible outcome of this lottery.

Prove that we can choose the probability $p$ of throwing heads, and the value of $k$ such that, by distributing the $2^k$ different outcomes between the children in the right way, we can guarantee that each child has the same probability of winning.
