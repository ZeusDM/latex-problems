We build a tower of $2\times 1$ dominoes in the following way. First, we place $55$ dominoes on the table such that they cover a $10\times 11$ rectangle; this is the first story of the tower. We then build every new level with $55$ domioes above the exact same $10\times 11$ rectangle. The tower is called \textit{stable} if for every non-lattice point of the $10\times 11$ rectangle, we can find a domino that has an inner point above it. How many stories is the lowest \textit{stable} tower?
