\playerA{A} and \playerB{B} play tennis. The player to first win at least four points and at least two more than the other player wins. We know that \playerA{A} gets a point each time with probability $p\le \frac12$, independent of the game so far. Prove that the probability that \playerA{A} wins is at most $2p^2$.
