A quadrilateral $ABCD$ is circumscribed about a circle with center $I$. A point $P \ne I$ is chosen inside $ABCD$ so that the triangles $PAB, PBC, PCD,$ and $PDA$ have equal perimeters. A circle $\Gamma$ centered at $P$ meets the rays $PA, PB, PC$, and $PD$ at $A_1, B_1, C_1$, and $D_1$, respectively. Prove that the lines $PI, A_1C_1$, and $B_1D_1$ are concurrent.
