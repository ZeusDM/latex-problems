Let $\Omega$  be the circumcircle of an acute-angled triangle $ABC$. A point $D$ is chosen on the internal bisector of $\angle ACB$ so that the points $D$ and $C$ are separated by $AB$. A circle $\omega$ centered at $D$ is tangent to the segment $AB$ at $E$. The tangents to $\omega$ through $C$ meet the segment $AB$ at $K$ and $L$, where $K$ lies on the segment $AL$. A circle  $\Omega_1$ is tangent to the segments $AL, CL$, and also to $\Omega$ at point $M$. Similarly, a circle $\Omega_2$ is tangent to the segments $BK, CK$, and also to  $\Omega$ at point $N$. The lines $LM$ and $KN$ meet at $P$. Prove that $\angle KCE = \angle LCP$.
