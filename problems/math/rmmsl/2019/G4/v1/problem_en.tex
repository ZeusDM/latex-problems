Let  $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of an acute-angled triangle $ABC$. Let $D$ be the midpoint of the minor arc $AB$ of $\Omega$. A circle  $\omega$ centered at $D$ is tangent to $AB$ at $E$. The tangents to $\omega$ through $C$ meet the segment $AB$ at $K$ and $L$, where $K$ lies on the segment $AL$. A circle  $\Omega_1$ is tangent to the segments $AL, CL$, and also to $ \Omega$  at point $M$. Similarly, a circle  $\Omega_2$ is tangent to the segments $BK, CK$, and also to  $\Omega$ at point $N$. The lines $LM$ and $KN$ meet at $P$. Prove that $\angle KCE = \angle LCP$.
