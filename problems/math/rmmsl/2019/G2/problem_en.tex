Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle. The line through $C$ perpendicular to $AC$ meets the external angle bisector of $\angle ABC$ at $D$. Let $H$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $D$ onto $BC$. The point $K$ is chosen on $AB$ so that $KH \parallel AC$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $AK$. Prove that $MC = MB + BH$.
