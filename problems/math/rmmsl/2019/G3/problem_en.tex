Let $ABC$ be an acute-angled triangle with $AB \ne AC$, and let $I$ and $O$ be its incenter and circumcenter, respectively. Let the incircle touch $BC, CA$ and $AB$ at $D, E$ and $F$, respectively. Assume that the line through $I$ parallel to $EF$, the line through $D$ parallel to$ AO$, and the altitude from $A$ are concurrent. Prove that the concurrency point is the orthocenter of the triangle $ABC$.
