Fix an integer $n \ge 2$. A fairy chess piece \textit{leopard } may move one cell up, or one cell to the right, or one cell diagonally down-left. A leopard is placed onto some cell of a $3n \times 3n$ chequer board. The leopard makes several moves, never visiting a cell twice, and comes back to the starting cell. Determine the largest possible number of moves the leopard could have made.
