Let $R=\left(ABE\right)\cap\left(ACD\right)$. Perform $\sqrt{bc}$ inversion and let $X^*$ be the image of $X$ for any point $X$. Then $E^*D^*$ is parallel to $BC$ and $R^*=CE^*\cap BD^*$. But by Ceva's theorem, $AR^*$ is the $A$-median of $\triangle{AE^*D^*}$, which is the $A$-median of $\triangle{ABC}$. Taking the inverse transformation, $AR$ is the $A$-symmedian of $\triangle{ABC}$.

Now, since $AR\perp PQ$ as $AR$ is the radical axis and $PQ$ is the center line of $\left(ABE\right),\left(ACD\right)$, $AR$ is the $A$-altitude of $\triangle{APQ}$. Then $AR$ and $AO$ are isogonal in $\angle{QAP}=\angle{BAC}$ and thus $AO$ is the $A$-median of $\triangle{ABC}$. It follows that $AO$ bisects $BC$.
