Determine all positive real numbers $ a$ such that there exists a positive integer $ n$ and sets $ A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ satisfying the following conditions:

(1) every set $ A_i$ has infinitely many elements;

(2) every pair of distinct sets $ A_i$ and $ A_j$ do not share any common element

(3) the union of sets $ A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ is the set of all integers;

(4) for every set $ A_i,$ the positive difference of any pair of elements in $ A_i$ is at least $ a^i.$
