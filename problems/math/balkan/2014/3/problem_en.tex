Let $ABCD$ be a trapezium inscribed in a circle $\Gamma$ with diameter $AB$. Let $E$ be the intersection point of the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ . The circle with center $B$ and radius $BE$ meets $\Gamma$ at the points $K$ and $L$ (where $K$ is on the same side of $AB$ as $C$). The line perpendicular to $BD$ at $E$ intersects $CD$ at $M$. Prove that $KM$ is perpendicular to $DL$.Greece - Silouanos Brazitikos
