The circles $\mathcal C_1$ and $\mathcal C_2$ touch each other externally at $D$,  and touch a circle $\omega$ internally at $B$ and $C$,  respectively. Let $A$ be an intersection point of $\omega$ and the common tangent to $\mathcal C_1$ and $\mathcal C_2$ at $D$. Lines $AB$ and $AC$ meet $\mathcal C_1$ and $\mathcal C_2$ again at $K$ and $L$,  respectively, and the line $BC$ meets $\mathcal C_1$ again at $M$ and $\mathcal C_2$ again at $N$. Prove that the lines $AD$,  $KM$,  $LN$ are concurrent.Greece
