A cube side 3 is divided into 27 unit cubes. The unit cubes are arbitrarily labeled 1 to 27 (each cube is given a different number). A move consists of swapping the cube labeled 27 with one of its 6 neighbours. Is it possible to find a finite sequence of moves at the end of which cube 27 is in its original position, but cube $n$ has moved to the position originally occupied by $27-n$ (for each $n = 1, 2, \ldots , 26$)?
