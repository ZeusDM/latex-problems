A strip of width $w$ is the set of all points which lie on, or between, two parallel lines distance $w$ apart. Let $S$ be a set of $n$ ($n \ge 3$) points on the plane such that any three different points of $S$ can be covered by a strip of width $1$.

Prove that $S$ can be covered by a strip of width $2$.
