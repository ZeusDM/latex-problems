Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with orthocentre $H$,  and let $M$ be the midpoint of $AC$. The point $C_1$ on $AB$ is such that $CC_1$ is an altitude of the triangle $ABC$. Let $H_1$ be the reflection of $H$ in $AB$. The orthogonal projections of $C_1$ onto the lines $AH_1$,  $AC$ and $BC$ are $P$,  $Q$ and $R$,  respectively. Let $M_1$ be the point such that the circumcentre  of triangle $PQR$ is the midpoint of the segment $MM_1$.

Prove that $M_1$ lies on the segment $BH_1$.
