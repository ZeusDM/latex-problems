A rectangle $ABCD$ has side lengths $AB = m$,  $AD = n$,  with $m$ and $n$ relatively prime and both odd. It is divided into unit squares and the diagonal AC intersects the sides of the unit squares at the points $A_1 = A, A_2, A_3, \ldots , A_k = C$. Show that \[ A_1A_2 - A_2A_3 + A_3A_4 - \cdots + A_{k-1}A_k = {\sqrt{m^2+n^2}\over mn}.  \]
