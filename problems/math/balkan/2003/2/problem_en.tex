Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and let the tangent to the circumcircle of the triangle $ABC$ at $A$ meet the line $BC$ at $D$. The perpendicular to $BC$ at $B$ meets the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ at $E$. The perpendicular to $BC$ at $C$ meets the perpendicular bisector of $AC$ at $F$. Prove that the points $D$,  $E$ and $F$ are collinear.Valentin Vornicu
