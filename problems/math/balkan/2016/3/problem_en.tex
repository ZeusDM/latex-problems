Find all monic polynomials $f$ with integer coefficients satisfying the following condition: there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $p$ divides $2(f(p)!)+1$ for every prime $p>N$ for which $f(p)$ is a positive integer.Note: A monic polynomial has a leading coefficient equal to 1.(Greece - Panagiotis Lolas and Silouanos Brazitikos)
