Let $k$ be a positive integer.  Determine the least positive integer $n$, with $n\geq k+1$, for which the game below can be played indefinitely:

Consider $n$ boxes, labelled $b_1,b_2,...,b_n$. For each index $i$, box $b_i$ contains exactly $i$ coins. At each step, the following three substeps are performed in order:
\textit{(1)} Choose $k+1$ boxes;
\textit{(2)} Of these $k+1$ boxes, choose $k$ and remove at least half of the coins from each, and add  to the remaining box, if labelled $b_i$, a number of $i$ coins.
\textit{(3)} If one of the boxes is left empty, the game ends; otherwise, go to the next step.
