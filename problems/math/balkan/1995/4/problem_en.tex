Let $n$ be a positive integer and $\mathcal S$ be the set of points $(x, y)$ with $x, y \in \{1, 2, \ldots , n\}$. Let $\mathcal T$ be the set of all squares with vertices in the set $\mathcal S$. We denote by $a_k$ ($k \geq 0$) the number of (unordered) pairs of points for which there are exactly $k$ squares in $\mathcal T$ having these two points as vertices. Prove that $a_0 = a_2 + 2a_3$.Yugoslavia
