Let $ABC$ be a triangle and let $M,N,P$ be points on the line $BC$ such that $AM,AN,AP$ are the altitude, the angle bisector and the median of the triangle, respectively. It is known that$\frac{[AMP]}{[ABC]}=\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{[ANP]}{[ABC]}=1-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Find the angles of triangle $ABC$.
