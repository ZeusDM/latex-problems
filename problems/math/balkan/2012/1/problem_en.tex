Let $A$,  $B$ and $C$ be points lying on a circle $\Gamma$ with centre $O$. Assume that $\angle ABC > 90$. Let $D$ be the point of intersection of the line $AB$ with the line perpendicular to $AC$ at $C$. Let $l$ be the line through $D$ which is perpendicular to $AO$. Let $E$ be the point of intersection of $l$ with the line $AC$,  and let $F$ be the point of intersection of $\Gamma$ with $l$ that lies between $D$ and $E$.

Prove that the circumcircles of triangles $BFE$ and $CFD$ are tangent at $F$.
