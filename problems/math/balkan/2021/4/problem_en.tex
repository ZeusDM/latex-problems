Angel has a warehouse, which initially contains $100$ piles of $100$ pieces of rubbish each.
Each morning, Angel performs exactly one of the following moves:
\begin{itemize}
	\item He clears every piece of rubbish from a single pile.
	\item He clears one piece of rubbish from each pile.
\end{itemize}

However, every evening, a demon sneaks into the warehouse and performs exactly one of the following moves:
\begin{itemize}
	\item He adds one piece of rubbish to each non-empty pile.
	\item He creates a new pile with one piece of rubbish.
\end{itemize}

What is the first morning when Angel can guarantee to have cleared all the rubbish from the warehouse?
