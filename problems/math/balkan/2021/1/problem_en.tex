Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $AB<AC$. Let $\omega$ be a circle passing through $B, C$ and assume that $A$ is inside $\omega$. Suppose $X, Y$ lie on $\omega$ such that $\angle BXA=\angle AYC$. Suppose also that $X$ and $C$ lie on opposite sides of the line $AB$ and that $Y$ and $B$ lie on opposite sides of the line $AC$. Show that, as $X, Y$ vary on $\omega$, the line $XY$ passes through a fixed point.
