A committee of $3366$ film critics are voting for the Oscars. Every critic voted just an actor and just one actress. After the voting, it was found that for every positive integer $n \in \left \{1, 2, \ldots, 100 \right \}$,  there is some actor or some actress who was voted exactly $n$ times. Prove that there are two critics who voted the same actor and the same actress.(Cyprus)
