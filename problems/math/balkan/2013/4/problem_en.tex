In a mathematical competition, some competitors are friends; friendship is mutual, that is, when $A$ is a friend of $B$,  then $B$ is also a friend of $A$.

We say that $n \geq 3$ different competitors $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ form a weakly-friendly cycle if $A_i$ is not a friend of $A_{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$ (where $A_{n+1} = A_1$), and there are no other pairs of non-friends among the components of the cycle.

The following property is satisfied:

"for every competitor $C$ and every weakly-friendly cycle $\mathcal{S}$ of competitors not including $C$,  the set of competitors $D$ in $\mathcal{S}$ which are not friends of $C$ has at most one element"

Prove that all competitors of this mathematical competition can be arranged into three rooms, such that every two competitors in the same room are friends.
