In a triangle $ABC$,  the excircle $\omega_a$ opposite $A$ touches $AB$ at $P$ and $AC$ at $Q$,  while the excircle $\omega_b$ opposite $B$ touches $BA$ at $M$ and $BC$ at $N$. Let $K$ be the projection of $C$ onto $MN$ and let $L$ be the projection of $C$ onto $PQ$. Show that the quadrilateral $MKLP$ is cyclic.
