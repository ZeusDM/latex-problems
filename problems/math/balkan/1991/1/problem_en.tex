Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle inscribed in a circle centered at $O$. Let $M$ be a point on the small arc $AB$ of the triangle's circumcircle. The perpendicular dropped from $M$ on the ray $OA$ intersects the sides $AB$ and $AC$ at the points $K$ and $L$,  respectively. Similarly, the perpendicular dropped from $M$ on the ray $OB$ intersects the sides $AB$ and $BC$ at $N$ and $P$,  respectively. Assume that $KL=MN$. Find the size of the angle $\angle{MLP}$ in terms of the angles of the triangle $ABC$.
