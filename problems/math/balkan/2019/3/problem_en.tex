Let $ABC$ be an acute scalene triangle. Let $X$ and $Y$ be two distinct interior points of the segment $BC$ such that $\angle{CAX} = \angle{YAB}$. Suppose that:$1)$ $K$ and $S$ are the feet of the perpendiculars from from $B$ to the lines $AX$ and $AY$ respectively.$2)$ $T$ and $L$ are the feet of the perpendiculars from $C$ to the lines $AX$ and $AY$ respectively.

Prove that $KL$ and $ST$ intersect on the line $BC$.
