Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $m$ a line which intersects the sides $AB$ and $AC$ at interior points $D$ and $F$,  respectively, and intersects the line $BC$ at a point $E$ such that $C$ lies between $B$ and $E$. The parallel lines from the points $A$,  $B$,  $C$ to the line $m$ intersect the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ at the points $A_1$,  $B_1$  and $C_1$,  respectively (apart from $A$,  $B$,  $C$). Prove that the lines $A_1E$, $B_1F$  and  $C_1D$  pass through the same point.Greece
