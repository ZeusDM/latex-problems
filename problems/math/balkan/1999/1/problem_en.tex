Let $O$ be the circumcenter of the triangle $ABC$. The segment $XY$ is the diameter of the circumcircle perpendicular to $BC$ and it meets $BC$ at $M$. The point $X$ is closer to $M$ than $Y$ and $Z$ is the point on $MY$ such that $MZ = MX$. The point $W$ is the midpoint of $AZ$.

a) Show that $W$ lies on the circle through the midpoints of the sides of $ABC$;

b) Show that $MW$ is perpendicular to $AY$.
