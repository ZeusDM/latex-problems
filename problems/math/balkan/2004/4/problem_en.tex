The plane is partitioned into regions by a finite number of lines no three of which are concurrent. Two regions are called "neighbors" if the intersection of their boundaries is a segment, or half-line or a line (a point is not a segment). An integer is to be assigned to each region in such a way that:

i) the product of the integers assigned to any two neighbors is less than their sum;

ii) for each of the given lines, and each of the half-planes determined by it, the sum of the integers, assigned to all of the regions lying on this half-plane equal to zero.

Prove that this is possible if and only if not all of the lines are parallel.
