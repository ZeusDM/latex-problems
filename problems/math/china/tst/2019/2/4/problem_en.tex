Does there exist a finite set $A$ of positive integers of at least two elements and an infinite set $B$ of positive integers, such that any two distinct elements in $A+B$ are coprime, and for any coprime positive integers $m,n$, there exists an element $x$ in $A+B$ satisfying $x\equiv n \pmod m$ ?

Here $A+B=\{a+b|a\in A, b\in B\}$.
