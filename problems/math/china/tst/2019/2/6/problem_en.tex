Given coprime positive integers $p,q>1$, call all positive integers that cannot be written as $px+qy$(where $x,y$ are non-negative integers) \textit{bad}, and define $S(p,q)$ to be the sum of all bad numbers raised to the power of $2019$. Prove that there exists a positive integer $n$, such that for any $p,q$ as described, $(p-1)(q-1)$ divides $nS(p,q)$.
