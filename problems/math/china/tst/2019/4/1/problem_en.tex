Cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$ has circumcircle $(O)$. Points $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of $BC$ and $CD$, and  $E$ and $F$ lie on $AB$ and $AD$ respectively such that $EF$ passes through $O$ and $EO=OF$.  Let $EN$ meet $FM$ at $P$. Denote $S$ as the circumcenter of $\triangle PEF$. Line $PO$ intersects $AD$ and $BA$ at $Q$ and $R$ respectively. Suppose $OSPC$ is a parallelogram.  Prove that $AQ=AR$.
