Let the $A$-intouch chord meet $BC$ at $T$. Since the quadrilateral formed by the three intouch points and $D$ is harmonic, $DT$ is tangent to the incircle. Then \[\measuredangle{EDT}=\measuredangle{TED}=\measuredangle{CEF}=\measuredangle{EFC}\] so $CF\parallel TD$. Then \[-1=(B,C;E,T)\stackrel{D}{=}(G,C;F,\infty_{CF})\] and thus $F$ is the midpoint of $CG$ as desired.
