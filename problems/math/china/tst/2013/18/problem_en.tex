A point $(x,y)$ is a lattice point if $x,y\in\Bbb Z$. Let $E=\{(x,y):x,y\in\Bbb Z\}$. In the coordinate plane, $P$ and $Q$ are both sets of points in and on the boundary of a convex polygon with vertices on lattice points. Let $T=P\cap Q$. Prove that if $T\ne\emptyset$ and $T\cap E=\emptyset$,  then $T$ is a  non-degenerate convex quadrilateral region.
