There are$n$ balls numbered $1,2,\cdots,n$,  respectively. They are painted with $4$ colours, red, yellow, blue, and green, according to the following rules:

First, randomly line them on a circle.

Then let any three clockwise consecutive balls numbered $i, j, k$,  in order.

1) If $i>j>k$,  then the ball $j$ is painted in red;

2) If $i<j<k$,  then the ball $j$ is painted in yellow;

3) If $i<j, k<j$,  then the ball $j$ is painted in blue;

4) If $i>j, k>j$,  then the ball $j$ is painted in green.

And now each permutation of the balls determine a painting method.

We call two painting methods distinct, if there exists a ball, which is painted with two different colours in that two methods.

Find out the number of all distinct painting methods.
