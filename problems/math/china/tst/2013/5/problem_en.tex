Let $P$ be a given point inside the triangle $ABC$. Suppose $L,M,N$ are the midpoints of $BC, CA, AB$ respectively and \[PL: PM: PN= BC: CA: AB.\] The extensions of $AP, BP, CP$ meet the circumcircle of $ABC$ at $D,E,F$ respectively. Prove that the circumcentres of $APF, APE, BPF, BPD, CPD, CPE$ are concyclic.
