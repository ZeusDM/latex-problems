The quadrilateral $ABCD$ is inscribed in circle $\omega$. $F$ is the intersection point of $AC$ and $BD$. $BA$ and $CD$ meet at $E$. Let the projection of $F$ on $AB$ and $CD$ be $G$ and $H$,  respectively. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $BC$ and $EF$,  respectively. If the circumcircle of $\triangle MNG$ only meets segment $BF$ at $P$,  and the circumcircle of $\triangle MNH$ only meets segment $CF$ at $Q$,  prove that $PQ$ is parallel to $BC$.
