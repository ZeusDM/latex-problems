I claim that \[\displaystyle\sum_{i\mid n}\displaystyle\sum_{j\mid n}\frac{nx_ix_j}{\lcm\left(i,j\right)}=\displaystyle\sum_{d\mid n}\varphi\left(d\right)\left(\displaystyle\sum_{k\mid\frac{n}{d}}x_k\right)^2\] for integers $n\geq2$. To prove this, we must compute the coefficients of $x_i^2$ and $x_ix_j$ on each side.

Note that $x_i^2$ with $i\mid n$ appears when $i=j$ only, so the coefficient of $x_i^2$ on the LHS is $\frac{n}{i}$. On the other hand, $x_i^2$ appears in the RHS sum under $d$ when $i\mid\frac{n}{d}$ (equivalently $d\mid\frac{n}{i}$). So the coefficient of $x_i^2$ on the RHS is $\displaystyle\sum_{d\mid\frac{n}{i}}\varphi\left(d\right)=\frac{n}{i}$ so the coefficients match.

Now, note that $x_ix_j$ with $i,j\mid n$ and $i\neq j$ appears on the LHS twice for $\left(i,j\right)$ and $\left(j,i\right)$, so the coefficient of $x_ix_j$ on the LHS is $\frac{2n}{\lcm\left(i,j\right)}$. On the other hand, $x_ix_j$ appears in the RHS sum under $d$ when $i,j\mid\frac{n}{d}$ (equivalently $d\mid\frac{n}{\lcm\left(i,j\right)}$), and it appears as $2x_ix_j$ in the squared part. So the coefficient of $x_ix_j$ on the RHS is $\displaystyle\sum_{d\mid\frac{n}{\lcm\left(i,j\right)}}2\varphi\left(d\right)=\frac{2n}{\lcm\left(i,j\right)}$ so the coefficients match.

Now, using this equality, we have that \[\displaystyle\sum_{i\mid n}\displaystyle\sum_{j\mid n}\frac{x_ix_j}{\lcm\left(i,j\right)}=\displaystyle\sum_{d\mid n}\frac{\varphi\left(d\right)}{n}\left(\displaystyle\sum_{k\mid\frac{n}{d}}x_k\right)^2\geq\frac{\varphi\left(n\right)}{n}x_1^2=\frac{\varphi\left(n\right)}{n}=\displaystyle\prod\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\] as desired.
