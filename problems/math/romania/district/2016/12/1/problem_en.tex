A ring $ A $ has property \textit{(P),} if $ A $ is finite and there exists $ (\{ 0\}\neq R,+)\le (A,+) $ such that $ (U(A),\cdot )\cong (R,+) . $ Show that:

\textit{a)} If a ring has property \textit{(P),} then, the number of its elements is even.
\textit{b)} There are infinitely many rings of distinct order that have property \textit{(P).}
