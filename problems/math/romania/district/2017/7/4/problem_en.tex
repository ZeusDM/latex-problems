We have a triangle with $ \angle BAC=\angle BCA. $ The point $ E $ is on the interior bisector of $ \angle ABC $ so that $ \angle EAB =\angle ACB. $ Let $ D $ be a point on $ BC $ such that $ B $ is on the segment $ CD $ (endpoints excluded) and $ BD=AB. $ Show that the midpoint of $ AC $ is on the line $ DE. $
