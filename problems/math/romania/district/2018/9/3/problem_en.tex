Let $AD$, $BE$, $CF$ be the heights of triangle $ABC$ and let $K$, $L$, $M$ be the orthocenters of triangles $AEF$, $BFD$ and $CDE$, respectively. Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ denote the centroids of triangles $DEF$ and $KLM$, respectively. Show that $HG_1 = G_1G_2$, where $H$ is the orthocenter of triangle $ABC$.
