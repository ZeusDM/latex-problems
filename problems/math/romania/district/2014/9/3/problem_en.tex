The medians $AD, BE$ and $CF$ of triangle $ABC$ intersect at  Let $P$ be a point lying in the interior of the triangle, not belonging to any of its medians. The line through $P$ parallel to $AD$ intersects the side $BC$ at  Similarly one defines the points $B_{1}$ and  Prove that
\[ \overline{A_{1}D}+\overline{B_{1}E}+\overline{C_{1}F}=\frac{3}{2}\overline{PG} \]
