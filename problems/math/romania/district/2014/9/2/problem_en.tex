Let $ABC$ be a triangle and let the points  such that                                                                                     \[ \frac{DB}{DC}=\frac{EC}{EA}=\frac{FA}{FB} \]
The half-lines $AD, BE,$ and $CF$ intersect the circumcircle of $ABC$ at points $M,N$ and  Prove that the triangles $ABC$ and $MNP$ share the same centroid if and only if the areas of the triangles $BMC, CNA$ and $APB$ are equal.
