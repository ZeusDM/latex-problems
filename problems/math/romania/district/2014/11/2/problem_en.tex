\begin{itemize}
	\item Let $f\colon\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ be a function such that
  and
  are continuous
functions. Prove that $f$ is also continuous.
	\item Give an example of a discontinuous function  with the following property: there exists an interval
 such that, for any $a$ in  the function   is continuous.
