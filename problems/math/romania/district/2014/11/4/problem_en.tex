Let $f\colon\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}^{\ast}$ be a strictly increasing function. Prove that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item There exists a decreasing sequence of positive real numbers,  converging to  such that  for all 
	\item If $(x_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a decreasing sequence of real numbers, converging to  then there exists a decreasing sequence of real numbers  converging to  such that  for all 
\end{itemize}
