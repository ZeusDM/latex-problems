Let $M$ be the set of palindromic integers of the form $5n+4$ where $n\ge 0$ is an integer.
\begin{itemize}
	\item If we write the elements of $M$ in increasing order, what is the $50^{\text{th}}$ number?
	\item Among all numbers in $M$ with nonzero digits which sum up to $2014$ which is the largest and smallest one?
\end{itemize}
