Let  We obtain a partition of $A$ if $A$ is written as a disjoint union of nonempty subsets.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Prove that there is no partition of $A$ such that the product of elements in each subset is a square.
	\item Prove that there exists a partition of $A$ such that the sum of elements in each subset is a square.
\end{itemize}
