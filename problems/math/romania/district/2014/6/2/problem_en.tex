We call a nonempty set $M$ good if its elements are positive integers, each
having exactly $4$ divisors. If the good set $M$ has $n$ elements, we denote by
$S_{M}$ the sum of all $4n$ divisors of its members (the sum may contain
repeating terms).

a) Prove that $A=\{2\cdot37,19\cdot37,29\cdot37\}$ is good and 

b) Prove that if the set $B$ is good and  then
