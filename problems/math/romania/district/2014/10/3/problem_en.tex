Let $p$ and $n$ be positive integers, with  and let $a$ be a real number such that  Prove that the set
\[ \mathcal {S}=\left\{\left\lfloor \log_{2}x\right\rfloor +\left\lfloor \log_{3}x\right\rfloor +\cdots+\left\lfloor \log_{p}x\right\rfloor\mid x\in\mathbb{R},a\leq x\leq a+n\right\} \]
has exactly $n+1$ elements.
