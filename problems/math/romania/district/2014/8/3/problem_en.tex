Let $ABCDEF$ be a regular hexagon with side length  At point  the perpendicular  with length  is erected on the hexagon's plane. The points $M, N, P, Q,$ and $R$ are the projections of point $A$ on the lines $SB, SC, SD, SE,$ and  respectively.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Prove that the points $M, N, P, Q, R$ lie on the same plane.
	\item Find the measure of the angle between the planes $(MNP)$ and 
\end{itemize}
