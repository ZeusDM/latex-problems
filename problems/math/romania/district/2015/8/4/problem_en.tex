Consider the rectangular parallelepiped $ ABCDA'B'C'D' $ and the point $ O $ to be the intersection of $ AB' $ and $ A'B. $ On the edge $ BC, $ pick a point $ N $ such that the plane formed by the triangle $ B'AN $ has to be parallel to the line $ AC', $ and perpendicular to $ DO'. $
Prove, then, that this parallelepiped is a cube.
