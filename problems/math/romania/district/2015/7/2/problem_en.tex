\textit{a)} Show that if two non-negative integers $ p,q $ satisfy the property that both $ \sqrt{2p-q} $ and $ \sqrt{2p+q} $ are non-negative integers, then $ q $ is even.

\textit{b)} Determine how many natural numbers $ m $ are there such that $ \sqrt{2m-4030} $ and $ \sqrt{2m+4030} $ are both natural.
