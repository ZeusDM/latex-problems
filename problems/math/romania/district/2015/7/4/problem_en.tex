At the exterior of the square $ ABCD $ it is constructed the isosceles triangle $ ABE $ with $ \angle ABE=120^{\circ} . M $ is the intersection of the bisector line of the angle $ \angle EAB $ with its perpendicular that passes through $ B; N $ is the intersection of the $ AB $ with its perpendicular that passe through $ M; P $ is the intersection of $ CN $ with $ MB. $
If $ G $ is the center of gravity of the triangle $ ABE, $ prove that $ PG $ and $ AE $ are parallel.
