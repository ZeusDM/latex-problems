\playerA{Jack} and \playerB{Jill} are playing a game tiling a $m \times n$ grid with $2 \times 1$ rectangles, with \playerA{Jack} going first. \playerB{Jill} wins the game if the entire grid is tiled while \playerA{Jack} wins if there is at least one $1 \times 1$ hole in the grid. If both play optimally determine, with proof, all pairs of positive integers $(m, n)$ such that \playerB{Jill} wins. Does anything change if \playerB{Jill} goes first?
