It's given system of equations
$a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+a_{1n}x_n=b_1$
$a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+a_{2n}x_n=b_2$
..........
$a_{n1}x_1+a_{n2}x_2+a_{nn}x_n=b_n$
such that $a_{11},a_{12},...,a_{1n},b_1,a_{21},a_{22},...,a_{2n},b_2,...,a_{n1},a_{n2},...,a_{nn},b_n,$ form an arithmetic sequence.If system has one solution find it
