Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral with center $O$ such that $BD$ bisects $AC.$ Suppose that the angle bisector of $\angle ABC$ intersects the angle bisector of $\angle ADC$ at a single point $X$ different than $B$ and $D.$ Prove that the line passing through the circumcenters of triangles $XAC$ and $XBD$ bisects the segment $OX.$
