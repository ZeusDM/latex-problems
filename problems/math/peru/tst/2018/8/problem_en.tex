You want to paint some edges of a regular dodecahedron red so that each face has an even number of painted edges (which can be zero). Determine from How many ways this coloration can be done.

Note: A regular dodecahedron has twelve pentagonal faces and in each vertex concur three edges. The edges of the dodecahedron are all different for the purpose of the coloring . In this way, two colorings are the same only if the painted edges they are the same.
