For each positive integer $m> 1$, let $P (m)$ be the product of all prime numbers that divide $m$.
Define the sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3,...$ as followed:
$a_1> 1$ is an arbitrary positive integer,
$a_{n + 1} = a_n  + P (a_n)$ for each positive integer $n$.
Prove that there exist positive integers $j$ and $k$ such that $a_j$ is the product of the first $k$  prime numbers.
