A \textit{power} is a positive integer of the form $a^k$, where $a$ and $k$ are positive integers with $k\geq 2$. Let $S$ be the set of positive integers which cannot be expressed as sum of two powers (for example, $4,\ 7,\ 15$ and $27$ are elements of $S$). Determine whether the set $S$ has a finite or infinite number of elements.
