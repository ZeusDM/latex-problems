Let $m$ and $n$ two given integers. Ana thinks of a pair of real numbers $x$, $y$ and then she tells Beto the values of $x^m+y^m$ and $x^n+y^n$, in this order. Beto's goal is to determine the value of $xy$ using that information. Find all values of $m$ and $n$ for which it is possible for Beto to fulfill his wish, whatever numbers that Ana had chosen.
