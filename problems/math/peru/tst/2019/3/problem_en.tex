Let $I,\ O$ and $\Gamma$ be the incenter, circumcenter and the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$, respectively. Line $AI$ meets $\Gamma$ at $M$ $(M\neq A)$. The circumference $\omega$ is tangent internally to $\Gamma$ at $T$, and is tangent to the lines $AB$ and $AC$. The tangents through $A$ and $T$ to $\Gamma$ intersect at $P$. Lines $PI$ and $TM$ meet at $Q$. Prove that the lines $QA$ and $MO$ meet at a point on $\Gamma$.
