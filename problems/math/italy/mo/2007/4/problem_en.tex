Having lost a bet to \playerB{Barbara}, \playerA{Alberto} proposes the following game. Starting with the numbers $0, 1, \dots, 1024$, \playerB{Barbara} deletes $2^9$ numbers on her choice; then \playerA{Alberto} deletes $2^8$ of the remaining numbers, then \playerB{Barbara} removes $2^7$ numbers, etc. At the end two numbers $a$ and $b$ remain. Then \playerA{Alberto} pays \playerB{Barbara} $|a-b|$ euros. What largest amount of money can \playerB{Barbara} earn independent of \playerA{Alberto}â€™s strategy?
