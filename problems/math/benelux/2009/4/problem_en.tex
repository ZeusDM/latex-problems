Given trapezoid $ABCD$ with parallel sides $AB$ and $CD$,  let $E$ be a point on line $BC$ outside segment $BC$,  such that segment $AE$ intersects segment $CD$. Assume that there exists a point $F$ inside segment $AD$ such that $\angle EAD=\angle CBF$. Denote by $I$ the point of intersection of $CD$ and $EF$,  and by $J$ the point of intersection of $AB$ and $EF$. Let $K$ be the midpoint of segment $EF$,  and assume that $K$ is different from $I$ and $J$.

Prove that $K$ belongs to the circumcircle of $\triangle ABI$ if and only if $K$ belongs to the circumcircle of $\triangle CDJ$.
