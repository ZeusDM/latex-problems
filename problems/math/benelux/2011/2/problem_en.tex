Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incentre $I$. The angle bisectors $AI$,  $BI$ and $CI$ meet $[BC]$,  $[CA]$ and $[AB]$ at $D$,  $E$ and $F$,  respectively. The perpendicular bisector of $[AD]$ intersects the lines $BI$ and $CI$ at $M$ and $N$,  respectively. Show that $A$,  $I$,  $M$ and $N$ lie on a circle.
