An ordered pair of integers $(m,n)$ with $1<m<n$ is said to be a Benelux couple if the following two conditions hold: $m$ has the same prime divisors as $n$,  and $m+1$ has the same prime divisors as $n+1$.

(a) Find three Benelux couples $(m,n)$ with $m\leqslant 14$.

(b) Prove that there are infinitely many Benelux couples
