Abby and Brian play the following game: They first choose a positive integer $N$. Then they write numbers on a blackboard in turn. Abby starts by writing a $1$. Thereafter, when one of them has written the number $n$,  the other writes down either $n + 1$ or $2n$,  provided that the number is not greater than $N$. The player who writes $N$ on the blackboard wins.

(a) Determine which player has a winning strategy if $N = 2011$.

(b) Find the number of positive integers $N\leqslant2011$ for which Brian has a winning strategy.

(This is based on ISL 2004, Problem C5.)
