Two circles $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ intersect at points $A$ and $Z$ (with $A\neq Z$). Let $B$ be the centre of $\Gamma_1$ and let $C$ be the centre of $\Gamma_2$. The exterior angle bisector of $\angle{BAC}$ intersects $\Gamma_1$ again at $X$ and $\Gamma_2$ again at $Y$. Prove that the interior angle bisector of $\angle{BZC}$ passes through the circumcenter of $\triangle{XYZ}$.For  points $P,Q,R$ that lie on a line $\ell$ in that order, and a point $S$ not on $\ell$,  the interior angle bisector of $\angle{PQS}$ is the line that divides $\angle{PQS}$ into two equal angles, while the exterior angle bisector of $\angle{PQS}$ is the line that divides $\angle{RQS}$ into two equal angles.
