Let $ABC$ be  an  acute  triangle  with  circumcentre $O$. Let $\mathit{\Gamma}_B$ be  the  circle through $A$ and $B$ that is tangent to $AC$,  and let $\mathit{\Gamma}_C$ be the circle through $A$ and $C$ that is tangent to $AB$.  An arbitrary line through $A$ intersects $\mathit{\Gamma}_B$ again in $X$ and $\mathit{\Gamma}_C$ again in $Y$. Prove that $|OX|=|OY|$.
