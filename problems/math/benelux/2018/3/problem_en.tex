Let $ABC$ be a triangle with orthocentre $H$,  and let $D$,  $E$,  and $F$ denote the respective midpoints of line segments $AB$,  $AC$,  and $AH$. The reflections of $B$ and $C$ in $F$ are $P$ and $Q$,  respectively.

(a) Show that lines $PE$ and $QD$ intersect on the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$.

(b) Prove that lines $PD$ and $QE$ intersect on line segment $AH$.
