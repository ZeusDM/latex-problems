An integer $n\geq 2$ having exactly $s$ positive divisors $1=d_1<d_2<\cdots<d_s=n$ is said to be good if there exists an integer $k$,  with $2\leq k\leq s$,  such that $d_k>1+d_1+\cdots+d_{k-1}$. An integer $n\geq 2$ is said to be bad if it is not good.

(a) Show that there are infinitely many bad integers.

(b) Prove that, among any seven consecutive integers all greater than $2$,  there are always at least four good integers.

(c) Show that there are infinitely many sequences of seven consecutive good integers.
