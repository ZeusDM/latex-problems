Let $n \ge 3$ be an integer. A frog is to jump along the real axis, starting at the point $0$ and making $n$ jumps: one of length $1$,  one of length $2$,  $\dots$ , one of length $n$. It may perform these $n$ jumps in any order. If at some point the frog is sitting on a number $a \le 0$,  its next jump must be to the right (towards the positive numbers). If at some point the frog is sitting on a number $a > 0$,  its next jump must be to the left (towards the negative numbers). Find the largest positive integer $k$ for which the frog can perform its jumps in such an order that it never lands on any of the numbers $1, 2, \dots , k$.
