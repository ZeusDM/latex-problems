On a line $l$ there are three different points $A$,  $B$ and $P$ in that order. Let $a$ be the line through $A$ perpendicular to $l$,  and let $b$ be the line through $B$ perpendicular to $l$. A line through $P$,  not coinciding with $l$,  intersects $a$ in $Q$ and $b$ in $R$. The line through $A$ perpendicular to $BQ$ intersects $BQ$ in $L$ and $BR$ in $T$. The line through $B$ perpendicular to $AR$ intersects $AR$ in $K$ and $AQ$ in $S$.

(a) Prove that $P$,  $T$,  $S$ are collinear.

(b) Prove that $P$,  $K$,  $L$ are collinear.(2nd Benelux Mathematical Olympiad 2010, Problem 3)
