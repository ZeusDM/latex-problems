A finite set of integers is called bad if its elements add up to $2010$. A finite set of integers is a Benelux-set if none of its subsets is bad. Determine the smallest positive integer $n$ such that the set $\{502, 503, 504, . . . , 2009\}$ can be partitioned into $n$ Benelux-sets.

(A partition of a set $S$ into $n$ subsets is a collection of $n$ pairwise disjoint subsets of $S$,  the union of which equals $S$.)(2nd Benelux Mathematical Olympiad 2010, Problem 1)
