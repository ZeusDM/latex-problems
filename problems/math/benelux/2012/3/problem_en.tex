In triangle $ABC$ the midpoint of $BC$ is called $M$. Let $P$ be a variable interior point of the triangle such that $\angle CPM=\angle PAB$. Let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of triangle $ABP$. The line $MP$ intersects $\Gamma$ a second time at $Q$. Define $R$ as the reflection of $P$ in the tangent to $\Gamma$ at $B$. Prove that the length $|QR|$ is independent of the position of $P$ inside the triangle.
