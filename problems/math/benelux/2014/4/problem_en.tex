Let $ABCD$ be a square. Consider a variable point $P$ inside the square for which $\angle BAP \ge 60^\circ.$ Let $Q$ be the intersection of the line $AD$ and the perpendicular to $BP$ in $P$. Let $R$ be the intersection of the line $BQ$ and the perpendicular to $BP$ from $C$.(a) Prove that $|BP|\ge |BR|$(b) For which point(s) $P$ does the inequality in (a) become an equality?
