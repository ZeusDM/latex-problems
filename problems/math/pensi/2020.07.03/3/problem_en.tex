Let $I$ be the incenter of acute triangle $ABC$ ($CA \neq CB$). $A_1$ is the tangent point between the excircle of $ABC$ opposite to $A$, and the side $BC$. $B_1$ is defined similarly. The line $CI$ intersects the circumcircle of $ABC$ again at $P$. $Q$ a point in the line $AB$ such that $QP$ is perpendicular to $CP$. Prove that the lines $QI$ and $A_1B_1$ are parallel.
