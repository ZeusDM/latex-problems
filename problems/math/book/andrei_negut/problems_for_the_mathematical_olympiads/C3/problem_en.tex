There is an ant which walks on the infinite lattice, but it can only walk upwards or to the right. There is an infinite sequence of points (which the ant knows) $(A_n)_{n > 0}$ such that immediately after the ant takes its $i$-th step, the point $A_i$ becomes poisoned. Prove that, given any sequence of points $(A_n)_{n > 0}$, there exists an infinite path that the ant can follow such that the ant never steps on a previously poisoned point.
