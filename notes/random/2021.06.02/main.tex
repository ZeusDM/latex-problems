\begin{document}
\begin{prob}
Ana and Banana are playing a game.
First Ana picks a word, which is defined to be a nonempty sequence of capital English letters.
Then Banana picks a nonnegative integer $k$ and challenges Ana to supply a word with exactly $k$ subsequences which are equal to Ana's word.
Ana wins if she is able to supply such a word, otherwise she loses.
For example, if Ana picks the word ``TST'',
and Banana chooses $k=4$, then Ana can supply the word ``TSTST'' which has 4 subsequences which are equal to Ana's word.
Which words can Ana pick so that she can win no matter what value of $k$ Banana chooses?
\end{prob}
